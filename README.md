1. Do not create any h6 elements if using RecipeScaler.js.
2. Do not create any tables if using RecipeScaler.js.. First table is for the image gallery. Second - for ingredients upscaling. Third - for history. 
3. Scaling ingredients doesn't work in the reading mode. On the contrary to this downside, scaled results won't be saved in next sessions.
