## Sourdough vs lievito madre

The difference between regular sourdough and lievito madre (further referenced as "the mother") lies not in hydration alone. The mother can range from 30-50% hydration and the bacteria present are prone to dealing with sweet, fatty doughs by having less acetic acid and bacteria, having more delicate, sweet flavor. This is perfect for [[Panettone (fruit version)|Panettone]]. That is why it is also stored and maintained differently.

## Converting sourdough to lievito madre

We can't just change the starter at once, expecting the bacteria to adapt immediately, this might be too stressful for them (they will become weak and too acidic due to imbalance) and we'd spent more time getting them back to normal before proceeding with the transitioning. That is why we have to do it gradually. I suggest you used [[Fruit water]] to condition the starter. Same as for sourdough, the liquid has three colonies (but in different proportions compared to sourdough):
- **Wild Yeasts** → Produce alcohol & CO₂ (not acid directly).
- **Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)** → Preferably produce lactic acid.
- **Potential Acetic Acid Bacteria (AAB)** → Only if oxygen is present long enough.

**The fruit water** greatly favors LAB when it's reach in sugars (haven't eaten all of them yet) which is the colony we exactly want to have in majority! It will provide additional nutrients to favor lactic bacteria. They will dominate, suppress yeast and result in less acetic acid (provided that we don't expose it to too much oxygen). Even if AAB exist in fruit water, they **need constant oxygen** to convert alcohol to acetic acid. - Since the starter is a dough (not liquid), there’s **very little oxygen inside**, so AAB can't really work. 

Conclusions:
- Use only **freshly fermented fruit water** (not over-fermented).
- **Store fruit water anaerobically** (in a closed bottle) to limit AAB growth.
- **Use it in the stiff starter, not in liquid form**, to further restrict AAB.

### Step 1. Conditioning the starter (3-5 days)
Due to the mentioned above reasons, we cannot as well jump to the target hydration immediately. If your starter is 100% hydration, lower it gradually. Mine is already at 60% and I can go to 50% right away.

Formula: 25g starter + 25g fruit water + 50 g flour

At **26°C**, LAB grow faster than yeasts. If we leave it **too long at 26°C**, it can over-ferment, leading to excess acid and potential gluten breakdown. Refrigerating after **peak** slows this down, preventing the accumulation of too much acidity.

Once it consistently triples, shift to one of the maintenance methods.
### Step 2. LM maintenance
Choose the hydration (30-50%). Better use 50% for tying. It dries out a lot. You may use 30-45% hydration of the water method as it will eventually accumulate some water.
#### Option 1. Tie method (the discards are too big this way, but this one is a traditional one)
- Shape the dough into a roll, wrap it in a clean linen cloth, and tie it with string.
- Let ferment at **15-16°C** for 24h, feed regularly
- Feeding formula example: 75g starter : 75g high-protein flour : 37g water 

#### Option 2. Water method (conserva in aqua). (Less traditional, but still right and convenient)
- Shape the dough into a roll / ball (or better roll it)
- Let ferment at **24°C** for 24h in room-temp water 3 times the volume of the LM, feed regularly
- Feeding formula example: 20g starter : 20g high-protein flour : 6g water (30C) **If** it takes too fast to start collapsing in 24 h, consider switching to 10g starter : 20 g high-protein flour : 6g water (26C)

### The day of kneading Panettone
#### 1. Bathing (bagnetto); optional, but highly recommended on the day of kneading

**If your LM smells too sour** (like vinegar or sharp acidity), **or if it rises very slowly**, any other issues with it, then it’s time for a bath. This could happen if there’s too much **acetic acid** building up. It is also a good idea to bathe it before warm feeding right before you make [[Panettone (fruit version)|Panettone]]. The idea is that by submerging LM in **cool, lightly sweetened water**, yeast will be refreshed and excess acidity will be removed into the water. This helps maintain a balanced microbial environment and strengthens LM for optimal fermentation.

**How-to:**
1. Prepare the bath. 26-27C water (3x times more than LM by weight), 5 g of sugar (per 1L) **if it's done during maintenance, not before the Panettone kneading, use colder water (15C)**
2. Cut your LM into 1-inch pieces, deflate each piece lightly so it can be submerged.
3. Leave in the water for 15-30 minutes. The faster it floats, the stronger the LM. The murkier the water is, the more acetic acid is left there.
4. Squeeze the excess liquid and proceed with the feedings, slightly reducing the water amount

#### 2. Warm feedings

Sticking to the recipe, perform the feedings. Despite of the method you use for the maintenance, you may use a lightly floured plastic bag for the feedings. The acidity won't accumulate due to the frequency of feedings. By the moment the last feeding is done, we can proceed with the Panettone if:
- LM has consistently tripled within the specified period of time
- the acidity after tripling at the last feeding lies within the range of **4.0 - 4.5 (4.0-4.2 ideally where, golden standards promise, 4.1 is perfect)**

> If the acidity is higher (**e.x. 5**), it means the starter is too alkali (not acidic enough), the fermentation is not active enough, too weak.
> If the acidity is too low (**e.x. 3.7**), it means the starter is too acidic, the balance of bacteria is off and the starter is not ready for Panettone.


### Feed ratios and peaking

Do not use high ratios, you will harm the microbial balance. The acidity will have been accumulated significantly.

### ✅ At **1:2 (or 1:3)**

Standard for maintenance and levain. Optimal amount of food, optimal balance. Fast peak.

- You _dilute_ the starter more → microbes have to multiply before acid and gas accumulate.
- That **takes time**: the yeast population builds steadily, producing a gentle, even rise.
- Peak (tripling) usually happens **in 4–5 hours** at 26 °C for a strong LM.
- Acidity stays moderate (pH ~4.2–4.4).

So yes — this is your **true peak**: maximum yeast expansion, balanced aroma, sweet smell.

### ✅ At **1:1 (or smaller ratio)**

Used in consecutive panettone feedings to feed the yeast and prevent peaking (which happens LONGER that a 1:2 because there is more competition for food) not to accumulate the acidity.

- You feed much less flour → you’re starting with a _heavier inoculation_ (many more microbes in less food).    
- That means the pH drops _faster_, fermentation becomes more intense early, but **food is exhausted sooner**.
- It _looks_ fast initially, but the dough plateaus earlier and would acidify if left as long.

In other words:

> 1:1 rises quickly at the start but **peaks earlier** and then collapses faster.  
> 1:2 or 1:3 take longer to reach the top but hold that peak beautifully.

So **it’s the opposite of what intuition suggests** — lower ratio = faster start, shorter total life; higher ratio = slower start, longer stable peak.
