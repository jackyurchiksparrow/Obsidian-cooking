## Basic idea

It adds additional yeast activity whether to the starter or to the dough. If the yeast in the fruit water are very **ACTIVE**, the starter/dough will rise **SLOWER** (more gradually) because fruit yeasts are way slower than wheat-based ones. However, fruit water brings additional nutrients that help stabilize the starter and support a **prolonged peak stage** (it holds the peak stage longer). As a result, this extended peak reduces the need for frequent feedings and provides a more consistent indicator of when the starter or dough is at peak activity.

## Hydration

When using fruit water, you may notice that your dough requires more water because fruit water often contains residual sugars, organic acids, and trace nutrients from the fruit itself.

- **Osmotic Pressure**: The sugars and minerals in fruit water can draw some of the free water molecules toward themselves. Manually added sugar tends to act the same way, drawing the moisture in itself.

- **Higher Enzyme Activity**: Fruit water can be rich in natural enzymes (like amylase), which accelerate starch breakdown. They break into sugars and sugars, as we mentioned in **osmotic pressure**, draw the water in and absorb it.
