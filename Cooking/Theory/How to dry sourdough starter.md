I have always used stiff starters, so I'll be writing in that context, but it must work with any starter.
1. Feed your starter every 12 hours with only white bread flour for at least 2-3 das until it's very active and triples in size. I used 1:2 ratio (50% hydration).
2. Wait until it has peaked or slightly after.
3. Lightly dust parchment with white bread flour. Cover you hand with flour.
4. Get you ripe levain onto the parchment. While adding more flour, pat it down into a thin layer.
5. Avoid direct sunlight, place it into the dark place and turn it over in 24 hours.
6. Snap into pieces and wait for 1-2 more days. Optionally grind it.

### Storage options:

|Location|Notes|
|---|---|
|Pantry|OK for short term (1–3 months)|
|Wine fridge (10–15°C)|Very good for 6+ months|
|Freezer|Best for 1+ year, especially vacuum sealed|


## ✅ To Reactivate Later

- Take 10–20g dried starter.
- Soak in 30–40g lukewarm water for 15–30 min.
- Add equal flour by weight.
- Let it ferment for 24h.
- Then feed as usual (may take 2–5 days to fully reactivate).
