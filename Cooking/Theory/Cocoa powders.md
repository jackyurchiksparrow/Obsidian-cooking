## "Natural" or "unprocessed" or "unsweetened" or "pure"

Cocoa powder is made from the solids left over after most of the fat is removed. It is fruity, complex, and bitter in flavor, light brown in color. High acidity naturally.

- **Characteristics:** Fruity, bitter, light brown, high acidity, 20-24% fat.
- **Use in baking:** Reacts with baking soda to provide leavening. Produces a light chocolate flavor.
- **Examples:** Ghirardelli Natural Cocoa, Hershey's Natural Cocoa.
- **Best for:** Recipes requiring baking soda for lift, or where a subtle cocoa flavor is desired.
- **Glaze:** Use sparingly if a fruity or lighter chocolate flavor is okay.

## Dutch-processed or alkalized

Made by soaking cocoa beans in an alkali solution—a process developed by a Dutch chemist in the 1800s—which neutralizes the acidity and cuts a bit of the bitterness. Darker in color than natural cocoa powder, and less harshly flavored. It creates what some people consider a richer, fudgier flavor in baked goods.

- **Characteristics:** Richer, darker chocolate flavor; low acidity; 10-22% fat.
- **Use in baking:** Works with baking powder (not soda). Produces a deep, balanced chocolate flavor.
- **Examples:** Valrhona Cocoa Powder, Guittard Cocoa Rouge.
- **Best for:** Cakes, brownies, and glazes requiring a fudgier flavor.
- **Glaze:** Excellent for smooth, rich chocolate coatings.

## Black cocoa powder (Heavily-alkalized)

This is a style of Dutch-process cocoa powder that—as a result of heavy, repeated processing—is extremely dark in color. If you’re looking to create a super dark baked good or chocolate sauce, this product is the key. Has even less fat than the regular Dutch one (so it's better to take 1/3 of this + 2/3 of Dutch to keep the cakes moist). 

- **Characteristics:** Extremely dark, earthy flavor, very low fat.
- **Use in baking:** Best mixed with Dutch-process cocoa to balance moisture and flavor.
- **Examples:** King Arthur Black Cocoa, Cacao Barry Extra Brute Black.
- **Best for:** Deeply colored and flavored cookies, cakes, and glazes (e.g., Oreos).
- **Glaze:** Perfect for an intense, dramatic look. Combine with Dutch cocoa for creamier consistency.

## Cacao powder

Cacao powder is the ground version of the whole cocoa pods and beans—they are still slightly processed, but at such a low temperature that the finished product is considered “raw.”

- **Characteristics:** Intensely bitter, slightly nutty, extremely acidic, very low fat.
- **Use in baking:** Works with baking soda but adds a strong, tart bitterness.
- **Examples:** Navitas Organics Cacao Powder, Viva Naturals.
- **Best for:** Savory dishes (stews, rubs) or recipes intentionally highlighting cacao’s raw flavor.
