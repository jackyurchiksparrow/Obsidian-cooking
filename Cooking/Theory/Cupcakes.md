## Common mistakes

1. Do not overmix the batter. You'll incorporate too much air and it will cause the cupcake to collapse during baking. They will rise immediately and fall after.
2. Do not bake at high temperature or with fan (or lower the temperature then). They will either or both rise immediately and fall after or burn before they're baked through.
