Gives goods additional moisture and extends their shelf life. Could be replaced with honey / maple syrup, but not for the exact same results.

In theory, the guidelines tell us that one should not substitute more than 20% of the granulated sugar content with inverted sugar AND not only that but, invert sugar is around 1.3x sweeter than regular granulated sugar 

## How to substitute?
cookie_recipe_sugar_content=100g 

let's say we replace 20% of this, so we take out 20g of the granulated sugar 
20g granulated_sugar = 20/1.3 inverted_sugar = 15g inverted_sugar 

So, your recipe will look like: 
80g granulated sugar 
15g [[Inverted sugar]]
