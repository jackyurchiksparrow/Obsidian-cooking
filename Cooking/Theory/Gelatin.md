Gelatin is an animal protein derived from collagen. The cheapest way to make it is applying water and heat to pork skins, then dry and grind everything.

Gelatin can be found in the form of sheets or powder. They don't have any direct correlation between each other, so **sheets and powders are the same**. They are the same terms of blooming strength.

## Gelatin sheets

More commonly found in the professional kitchen. There are four grades of sheets based on their **bloom strength**:
- bronze - 125 - 155 strength (3.3 g)
- silver - 160 strength (2.6 g)
- gold - 190 - 220 strength (2 g)
- platinum - 235 - 265 strength (1.7 g)

! But, each of them have weights per sheet, the more the weight, the less blooming strength. It means that **any sheet grade will be exactly the same as any other**, the only difference is weight.

## Gelatin powder


## How much gelatin to use?

You take any LIQUID that you want to gel and add the amount of gelatin equal to **0.6 - 1.7%**. On average, it is usually **1%**, it is exactly enough to set the liquid, but you'll need more to let it hold its shape based on other ingredients and its mass.
