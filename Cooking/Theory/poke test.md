## Theory; when to bake?

The general theory suggests that when you poke the dough lightly with your finger:
- it springs back fast and/or feels dense - it is not ready for baking
- it springs back slowly and recover; feels soft - almost ready for baking - you may start preheating the oven
- it springs back slowly and almost doesn't recover; feels soft - ready for baking
- it doesn't spring back at all or very little; feels very soft - it's overfermented

## When to put into the fridge?

Since it will be fermenting in the fridge more or less actively, we need to find a stage somewhere between the 1st and 2nd stage. Put it into the fridge overnight:
- if your dough has malt / rye flour and high hydration, you want to wait until the indentation kind of STARTS to spring back slowly-ish.
- if it's a strong wheat dough and high hydration, you want to wait until the indentation DOES spring back slowly-ish.

So, if the first point is the end of the first stage, the second point - is a bit closer to the middle of the second phase.
