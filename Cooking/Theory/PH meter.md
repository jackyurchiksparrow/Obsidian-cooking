A device that is able to measure acidity of the dough. The ones that measure the acidity of the liquids are wrong, it won't be accurate.

## Calibration

Calibrate according to the manual, but do this only when it is going to be used soon after.
Immediately take the third solution of your own and memorize the brand of it (acetic acid). Check the acidity and note it down for future reference.

## Do I discard the calibration solutions?

If you plan on using the pH meter in the nearest 2-3 weeks frequently, refrigerate them in glass containers with a lid. If they appear cloudy or smelly, not transparent, they've gone bad.
## When to calibrate again

If stored and used correctly, check every 2-3 weeks. You can use a few hacks:
- pour white, 5% Acetic Acid. If the acidity is far from the range of **2.0 - 3.0**, calibrate.
- Dissolve **1 tsp baking soda in 250 ml distilled water** → Expected pH: **~8.3**

## After using

Rinse with cold distilled! water. Gently shake it off. Then, **immediately** put into a sponge test lab (soaked in KCl) to retain moisture, increase the duration of probe service and postpone the next calibration.

### Stage 1: Converting stiff starter to LM (approx. 2 weeks)

| **Step**     | **Actions**                                                                                                                 | **Time & Temp**                                                                                                       | **Wine Cellar (15°C) Option?**                                                   | **Fridge (4°C) Option?**                                                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Day 1-3**  | Begin feeding at **50% hydration** (1:1:0.5 flour:starter:water).                                                           | Ferment at **20-22°C** for **4-6 hours**, then refrigerate overnight.                                                 | ❌ No need yet.                                                                   | ✅ Store overnight in the fridge.                                                |
| **Day 4**    | Perform **Bagnetto (Water Bath):** Soak in **20-22°C water + 2g sugar per liter** for **30 min**. Drain and squeeze gently. | Refresh: **100g flour, 50g starter, 45-50g water**. Ferment at **20-22°C for 4-6 hours**, then refrigerate overnight. | **✔️ If cellar stays at ~15°C overnight, you can use it instead of the fridge.** | **✅ If the cellar is below 14°C, store in the fridge overnight.**               |
| **Day 5-7**  | Repeat **daily feeding at 50% hydration**. Each day, check rise & pH before next feed.                                      | **4-6 hours at 20-22°C**, then store overnight.                                                                       | **✔️ Use cellar if stable.**                                                     | **✅ If cellar fluctuates below 14°C, use fridge.**                              |
| **Day 8-14** | Start **tying it up** (wrap in cloth and twine). Continue feeding **daily**.                                                | Ferment **4-6 hours at 20-22°C**, then store overnight.                                                               | **✔️ Cellar is preferred if stable (15°C).**                                     | **✅ If cellar is too cold, fridge is safer but must be warmed before feeding.** |

### Phase 2: Maintenance (After Conversion)

#### Option 1: Regular Maintenance for Weekly Use (Panettone, Brioche, etc.)

| **Step**                            | **Action**                                                                  | **Time & Temp**                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Every day**                       | Refresh (1 starter : 1 water : 2 flour ratio), ferment **24 hours at 15°C** | **Store at 15°C (if stable) or fridge (if cellar is too cold).** |
| **If Not Using for a Week**         | Refresh and store wrapped **tightly**.                                      | **Fridge (4°C) for up to 1 week.**                               |
| **Before Baking (Panettone, etc.)** | Do a **Bagnetto** (water bath) before intensive feeding cycles.             | **Follow pre-Panettone refresh cycles.**                         |

#### Option 2: Long-Term Storage (1-2 Weeks Without Feeding)

| **Step**                | **Action**                             | **Time & Temp**                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Every 1-2 Weeks**     | Refresh and **store wrapped tightly**. | **Fridge (4°C).**                                  |
| **Before Reactivating** | Soak in water bath **before feeding**. | **20-22°C water for 30 min, then resume feeding.** |

### How to Choose Between (15°C) and Fridge (4°C)

| **Condition**                                  | **Wine Cellar (15°C)**                                   | **Fridge (4°C)**                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Stable at 15°C**                             | ✅ Best option for lievito madre maintenance.             | ❌ Not needed.                       |
| **Cellar fluctuates (drops below 14°C often)** | ⚠️ Use only if it stays **above 14°C** most of the time. | ✅ More stable option.               |
| **Leaving for more than a week**               | ❌ Not ideal for long-term storage.                       | ✅ Keeps it dormant.                 |
| **Before making Panettone**                    | ✅ Can stay here between feedings.                        | ❌ Too cold—must be warmed up first. |
