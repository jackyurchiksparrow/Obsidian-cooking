A device that is able to measure acidity of the dough. The ones that measure the acidity of the liquids are wrong, it won't be accurate.
Extremely useful for [[Lievito madre]] where the perfect value after the very last feeding between panettone is **4.1**.
## Calibration

Calibrate according to the manual, but do this only when it is going to be used soon after.
Immediately take the third solution of your own and memorize the brand of it (acetic acid). Check the acidity and note it down for future reference.

## Do I discard the calibration solutions?

If you plan on using the pH meter in the nearest 2-3 weeks frequently, refrigerate them in glass containers with a lid. If they appear cloudy or smelly, not transparent, they've gone bad.
## When to calibrate again

If stored and used correctly, check every 2-3 weeks. You can use a few hacks:
- pour white, 5% Acetic Acid. If the acidity is far from the range of **2.0 - 3.0**, calibrate.
- Dissolve **1 tsp baking soda in 250 ml distilled water** â†’ Expected pH: **~8.3**

## After using

Rinse with cold distilled! water. Gently shake it off. Then, **immediately** put into a sponge test lab (soaked in KCl) to retain moisture, increase the duration of probe service and postpone the next calibration.
