A device that is able to measure acidity of liquid or (depending on the device) semi-solid entities (such as dough and other foods). 
Extremely useful for [[Lievito madre]] where the perfect value after the very last feeding between panettone is **4.1**.

## Before first use
1. Soak in cleaning solution for an hour (just in case).
2. Rinse with distilled water by inserting the electrode in and stirring. Discard the water.
3. Soak in storage solution for an hour

## (Re)calibrate when:

- first use
- stored in noisy environments where vibrations affect it frequently
- used every day -> recalibrate every 7-10 days
- the batteries are changed
- the readings are inconsistent / clearly off
- electrode wasn't stored properly and/or dried out
- was stored correctly but unused for 2 weeks+

## Calibration

Calibrate according to the manual of the device. Prepare the bought solution also according to their instructions. I use single-use sachets. Only makes sense to do if it is going to be used soon after (see "recalibrate when" section).

In the case of YY-1033 PH meter:
1. Connect the device to the app and check that calibration setting is set to your initial solution (*6.86* or *7.00*).
2. Remove from storage solution (it is mandatory for it to have spent it at least 1-2 hours prior to calibration)
3. Rinse the electrode with distilled water (should it be a bigger glass).
4. (Optional) Blot gently with lint-free tissue or a paper towel (do not put pressure with your fingers).
5. Put the electrode into each of the three solutions in this exact order (the first two are must have): either 
	either/or:
		- Asian standard: *6.86*/*4.00*/*9.18*
		- EU standard: *7.00*/*4.00*/*10.01*
	a. Choose the respective standard in settings.
	b. Put the meter into the first solution. Press and hold the "CAL" button for 5 second. As soon as the number on the screen has blinked three times and stopped blinking, rinse in distilled water again.
	c. Same for second solution.
	d. Same for third solution.
6. Clean with distilled water again, shake it off and store in storage solution or proceed to measuring.

## Usage

1. If it is calibrated, insert the electrode into the softest and wettest part of the dough's surface with rotating motions, no protection sleeves, nothing. Measure. You may slice it and them measure inside again to ensure precision.
2. Clean with distilled water, ensure no dough residue or staff. Wipe gently if any residue is visible.
3. Put back into storage solution. Always mark the last calibration date or track in the app.

## Connection to the app

It is mandatory to connect to the app via Bluetooth in order to check calibration settings before calibration (Asian / EU standard) to know what solution set to use. It is not required for the usage itself.

However, it won't connect unless:  
1. The Bluetooth is on on both devices  
2. Location is enabled on the phone  
3. The app is the last version  
4. The app has location permission in settings -> apps -> YINMIK -> permissions

## Do I discard the calibration solutions?

For single-use ones (like *4.01* sachets) do not store. For powdered *6.86* - possible if stored in the fridge airtight for 2-4 weeks. I would say 2 at most 3 recalibrations given that it successfully reads *4.01* afterwards (means the solution is still fine). Any signs of mold or cloudiness - discard immediately.
