### Definition

Involves precooking some of the flour in the recipe with a liquid, typically
milk, until the mixture turns into a thick paste. Adding this paste to the
dough brings softness and a little extra sweetness, making for
extraordinarily tender and squishy rolls.

### Tangzhong Timing

Be sure to make the tangzhong with plenty of time for
it to cool to room temperature before mixing it into
the dough. Alternatively, you can make the tangzhong
the night before, let it cool for a few minutes on the
counter, cover, and refrigerate it overnight. The next
day, let it come to room temperature before mixing
into the dough.
