## First:

### Your sourdough contains seeds / other grains (soaker):
0. In a tall jar, combine the seed soaker ingredients, cover, and let sit until called for during mixing. If you need it shortly - use boiling water, if no - room temperature water.

When you starter has peaked:
1. Mix all wet ingredients.
2. Dissolve or tear the starter.
3. Combine the dry ingredients on top, mix.
4. Wait for 30 minutes until fermentolyse.
5. Perform initial kneading by tucking the dough under itself.
6. Keep resting it for ~30 min and give stretches and folds. Stop when the dough looks puffy.

## Then:
### Your sourdough contains rye malt / rye flour or both:

1. When the [[Poke test]] shows that the finger indentation starts springing back slowly - bake. If slightly slower - put it in the fridge for 8 - 10 hours.

### Your sourdough doesn't contain any rye:


1. When the [[Poke test]] shows that the finger indentation starts springing back slowly and the indentation almost remains or almost doesn't recover - bake. If it's slowly springs back - put it in the fridge for 8 - 10 hours.

## Baking:

### Pan loaf

1. Preheat the oven to 240C for 15 min. Brush or spritz with water or milk generously. Lower the temperature to 200C and bake 50-60 min more or until the inner temperature is 98C.
2. Cool it down at least one hour before slicing into.
### Free-standing loaf

1. Preheat the oven to 240C for 40 min. Bake 30 min with steam and a lid, 20-25 minutes - no steam no lead, 220C.
2. Cool it down at least one hour before slicing into.
