## Batter consistency

Cupcake batter should generally have a **smooth, pourable consistency**—not too thick, not too runny.

### ✅ **Ideal Consistency**

- **Thicker than pancake batter** but thinner than cookie dough.
- **Flows slowly off a spoon or spatula**—like a thick ribbon.
- **Spoonable or pourable**, depending on the recipe (some lean more liquid, especially oil-based or egg-free batters).

## Common mistakes

1. Do not overmix the batter. You'll incorporate too much air and it will cause the cupcake to collapse during baking. They will rise immediately and fall after.
2. Do not bake at high temperature or with fan (or lower the temperature then). They will either or both rise immediately and fall after or burn before they're baked through.
