## How to freeze

It is simple, the most crucial step is how you package the sourdough before freezing. Here are the rules:
- Make sure the sourdough bread has cooled fully before you wrap it for freezing.
- Wrap the sourdough in aluminum foil, ensuring that it's fully covered (Shiny side touches bread).
- Either use a zip-log bag, place the bread there and squeeze as much air as possible or vacuum it with a vacuum sealer (then be careful not to destroy the loaf with pressure of sucking too much).

## For how long can I freeze it

Sourdough bread can be frozen for up to 2 months without losing superior texture and taste. It will last in the freezer for longer than this. But it will deteriorate in texture and taste after this 2 month period. 

## How to unfreeze it (sourdough bread)

1. Remove it from the freeze, get it out of the bag, allow your bread to defrost inside the foil wrap. Leaving it on the counter while it defrosts is fine.
2. When it's thawed, unwrap the sourdough and spritz it all over with water mist. Don't worry about using too much water, it will not go soggy.  
3. Place your damp sourdough bread into a hot 200C oven for 5-10 minutes.  
4. Remove sourdough from oven and use as normal. You don't have to wait until it cools down as the texture had already been set!

## How to unfreeze it (tender sourdough, like brioche)
1. Follow the same instructions, but use gentler heat (160-180C). Enriched doughs brown quickly.
2. Add the water modestly before baking.
