### Stage 3

**Classic 25% whole wheat version**, **Orange version**, **Coconut version**:
12. [[How much dough goes into the mold||Divide]] and preshape. If the easily shape into balls,  place in the molds. Otherwise, let them rest for 30 minutes, shape again and place into the molds. COVER! If some already seem dry, apply a thin layer of milk on top.
13. Proof for 5-8 hours at 25-26C or until passes the [[poke test]] and almost risen to the edges. The dough should be soft and leave a SMALL indent (not restoring completely or doing so very slowly), still MUST retain certain pressure to a finger!
