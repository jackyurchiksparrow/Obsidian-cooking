## Directions:


**My method**:
1. Overnight: make the levain. Only white flour (Zernari) with milk. Soak the dried fruit in tap water with a splash of rum.
2. Take the butter from the fridge to soften in advance.
3. Tear your levain into the bowl of stand mixer, add all the flours (sieve the whole wheat), milk, inverted sugar, sugar, vanilla sugar, yolks, eggs and salt. When the dough is mixed or gathered, leave it to rest 10-30 min (especially if it feels like it doesn't want to knead).
4. When the dough is smooth and strong, add cubed butter in 5-6 additions.
5. If the dough isn't soft enough, add a bit of cold water. Then add all the dry fruit, squeezed and patted dry gently.
6. Let it ferment until it doubles in size (presumably 5-8 hours). 
7. [[How much dough goes into the mold||Divide]] into pieces based on your molds, COVER and wait until there's about 3 cm left to the top (about 6 hours) and start preheating the oven to 180C fan. Assess with the [[Poke test]] as usual, the dough should be soft and leave a small indent (not restoring completely or doing so very slowly). 
8. Bake at 180C for about 30 min until the top is golden brown. If the oven is overcrowded, reduce the heat or bake without fan.
