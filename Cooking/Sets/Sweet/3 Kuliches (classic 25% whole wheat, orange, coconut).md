## Directions:

Day 1:
**10:00 a.m.** Feed LM: 20g LM : 20g **water** : 40g white flour **at room temp**
**10:00 p.m.-12:00 p.m.** Feed LM: 80g LM: 108g **milk** : 216g white flour **at 25-26C** for at least 12 hours, when it's fully expanded, not growing anymore and bubbly all over

4. When the dough looks smooth and incorporated, add cubed butter in 5-6 additions.
5. If the dough is very stiff, add a bit of the remaining coconut cream. Otherwise - start adding coconut flakes, bit by bit. Do this until all coconut flakes are incorporated and the dough is strong and soft.
6. Add the almonds. If the dough isn't soft still, add more cream.

### Stage 3

**Classic version**, **Red velvet version**, **Chocolate version**
12. [[How much dough goes into the mold||Divide]] and preshape. If the easily shape into balls,  place in the molds. Otherwise, let them rest for 30 minutes, shape again and place into the molds. COVER! If some already seem dry, apply a thin layer of milk on top.
13. Proof for 5-8 hours at 25-26C or until passes the [[poke test]] and almost risen to the edges. The dough should be soft and leave a SMALL indent (not restoring completely or doing so very slowly), still MUST retain certain pressure to a finger!
14. Brush with milk. Bake at 180C fan for 10 min, then 20-30 minutes 160 no fan until the internal temperature is 93-98%. Do not overcrowd the oven or they will burn on the sides due to the fan.
