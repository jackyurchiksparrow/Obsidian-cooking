**10:00 a.m.** Feed LM: 20g LM : 20g **water** : 40g white flour **at room temp**
**10:00 p.m.-12:00 p.m.** Feed LM: 80g LM: 95g **milk** : 190g white flour **at 25-26C** for at least 12 hours, when it's fully expanded, not growing anymore and bubbly all over

Soak the raisins and cranberries in water with a splash of rum overnight.

### Stage 1

When LM has peaked:

**Classic 25% whole wheat version**:
1. Tear your levain into the bowl of stand mixer, add milk and the eggs, start mixing. 
2. When it starts to show bubbles, add all the flours. The dough will be very stiff, gather it.
3. Add all sugar with 1/3 of egg yolks. Wait for a strong dough again. Gather it.
4. Add salt, resume mixing and slowly drizzle 1/3 more of egg yolks. Incorporate and gather again.
5. Add inverted sugar/honey, the remaining egg yolks and vanilla extract. Gather again.
6. Give a break to this one. Let it rest covered (in the fridge if it's hot outside).

2. When it starts to show bubbles, add all the flours and turmeric/orange powder.  The dough will be very stiff, gather it.
3. Add all sugar with orange zest and 1/3 of egg yolks. Wait for a strong dough again. Gather it.
4. Add salt, resume mixing and slowly drizzle 1/3 more of the remaining egg yolks. Incorporate and gather again.
5. Add inverted sugar/honey, the remaining egg yolks and vanilla extract. Gather again.
6. Give a break to this one. Let it rest covered (in the fridge if it's hot outside).

**Coconut version**:
1. Add the coconut cream and the levain. Mix thoroughly.
2. Add all the flours. The dough will be very stiff, gather it.
3. Add all sugar with 1/3 of the eggs. Wait for a strong dough again. Gather it.
4. Add salt, resume mixing and slowly drizzle 1/3 more of the remaining eggs. Incorporate and gather again.
5.  Add inverted sugar/honey, the remaining eggs and vanilla extract. Gather again.
6. Give a break to this one. Let it rest covered (in the fridge if it's hot outside).

### Stage 2

**Classic 25% whole wheat version**:
5. When the dough looks smooth and incorporated, add cubed butter in 5-6 additions. Gather a few times while adding.
6. Assess the dough before adding inclusions, if it's still stiff, add some milk, but extremely slowly while kneading.
7. Add the inclusions on low and knead for a few minutes. If the dough isn't soft and pleasant, add a bit more milk.
8. Place into a sealable container for 8-10 hours at 25-26C until doubled.

**Orange version**:
6. When the dough looks smooth and incorporated, add cubed butter in 5-6 additions. Gather a few times while adding.
7. Assess the dough before adding inclusions, if it's still stiff, add some milk, but extremely slowly while kneading.
8. Add the inclusions on low and knead for a few minutes. If the dough isn't soft and pleasant, add a bit more milk.
9. Place into a sealable container for 8-10 hours at 25-26C until doubled.

**Coconut version**:
5. When the dough looks smooth and incorporated, add cubed butter in 5-6 additions. Gather a few times while adding.
6. Assess the dough before adding inclusions, if it's still stiff, add some **cream (milk)**, but extremely slowly while kneading.
7. Add the inclusions on low **gradually** and knead for a few minutes. If the dough isn't soft and pleasant, add a bit more liquid.
8. Place into a sealable container for 8-10 hours at 25-26C until doubled.

### Stage 3

**Classic 25% whole wheat version**, **Orange version**, **Coconut version**:
12. [[How much dough goes into the mold||Divide]] and preshape. If the easily shape into balls,  place in the molds. Otherwise, let them rest for 30 minutes, shape again and place into the molds. COVER! If some already seem dry, apply a thin layer of milk on top.
13. Proof for 5-8 hours at 25-26C or until passes the [[poke test]] and almost risen to the edges. The dough should be soft and leave a SMALL indent (not restoring completely or doing so very slowly), still MUST retain certain pressure to a finger!
14. Brush with milk. Bake at 180C fan for 10 min, then 20-30 minutes 160 no fan until the internal temperature is 93-98C. Do not overcrowd the oven or they will burn on the sides due to the fan.
