## Directions:

Day 1:
**10:00 a.m.** Feed LM: 20g LM : 20g **water** : 40g white flour **at room temp**
**10:00 p.m.-12:00 p.m.** Feed LM: 80g LM: 95g **milk** : 190g white flour **at 25-26C** for at least 12 hours, when it's fully expanded, not growing anymore and bubbly all over

Soak the raisins and cranberries in water with a splash of rum overnight.
Roast almonds.

Day 2 
1. Take butter from the fridge in advance (2 pckgs).
2. Separate the eggs (11 pcs.) into 3 cups. Egg yolks (8), egg whites (8), eggs (3). Whisk egg yolks and eggs to properly measure them for the doughs.

### Stage 1

When LM has peaked:

**Classic 25% whole wheat version**:
1. Tear your levain into the bowl of stand mixer, add milk (hold 50g!) and the eggs, start mixing.
2. When it starts to show bubbles, add all the flours.
3. When the dough looks gathered, add yolks and salt. Wait for smoothness.
4. Give a break to this one. Let it rest covered (in the fridge if it's hot outside).

**Orange version**:
1. Tear your levain into the bowl of stand mixer, add milk (hold 50g!), orange juice and the eggs, start mixing.
2. When it starts to show bubbles, add all the flours and turmeric/orange powder.

### Stage 2

**Classic 25% whole wheat version**:
5. After the break, add inverted sugar/honey, sugar, vanilla sugar.
6. When the dough looks smooth and incorporated, add cubed butter in 5-6 additions.
7. When the dough looks smooth again
8. Assess the dough before adding inclusions, if it's not soft and tender, add the reserved milk (or even more) but extremely slowly.
9. Add the inclusions on low and knead for a few minutes. If the dough is stiff again, add a bit more milk.
10. Place into a sealable container for 8-10 hours at 25-26C until doubled.

**Orange version**:
6. After the break, add inverted sugar/honey, sugar, vanilla sugar, orange zest.
7. When the dough looks smooth and incorporated, add cubed butter in 5-6 additions.
8. When the dough looks smooth again
9. Assess the dough before adding inclusions, if it's not soft and tender, add the reserved milk (or even more) but extremely slowly.
10. Add the inclusions on low and knead for a few minutes. If the dough is stiff again, add a bit more milk.
11. Place into a sealable container for 8-10 hours at 25-26C until doubled.

**Coconut version**:
5. After the break, add inverted sugar/honey, sugar, vanilla sugar.
6. When the dough looks smooth and incorporated, add cubed butter in 5-6 additions.

8. Assess the dough before adding inclusions, if it's not soft and tender, add the reserved coconut **cream** (or even more coconut **milk**) but extremely slowly.
9. Add the inclusions on low **gradually** and knead for a few minutes. If the dough is stiff again, add a bit more coconut milk.

### Stage 3

**Classic 25% whole wheat version**, **Orange version**, **Coconut version**:
12. [[How much dough goes into the mold||Divide]] and preshape. If the easily shape into balls,  place in the molds. Otherwise, let them rest for 30 minutes, shape again and place into the molds. COVER! If some already seem dry, apply a thin layer of milk on top.
13. Proof for 5-8 hours at 25-26C or until passes the [[poke test]] and almost risen to the edges. The dough should be soft and leave a SMALL indent (not restoring completely or doing so very slowly), still MUST retain certain pressure to a finger!
14. Brush with milk. Bake at 180C fan for 10 min, then 20-30 minutes 160 no fan until the internal temperature is 93-98C. Do not overcrowd the oven or they will burn on the sides due to the fan.
