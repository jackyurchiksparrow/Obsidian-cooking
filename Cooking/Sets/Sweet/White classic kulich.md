### **Recommended Mixing Method (Stand Mixer, Dough Hook)**

1. **Preliminary Prep:**
    - Soak your dried fruit in warm water and rum well in advance. (10-15% rum + 85-90% rum).
    - Bring **butter** to ~15–18°C (cool and pliable).
    - Have your **levain** at its peak, nicely domed and active.
    - Separate the eggs (12 pcs.) into 3 cups. Egg yolks (9), egg whites (9), eggs (3).
2. **Autolyze Base Dough (optional but recommended):**
    - Whisk **all eggs + all yolks** + **half the sugar**.
    - Add **the milk**, mix.
    - Add **all flours**, combine into a dough in a stand mixer until just combined. Let rest for **20-30 minutes**; covered. This hydrates the flour, kick-starts gluten, and makes later mixing smoother.
    - Wash the hook, put it into the freezer.
    - Measure **the milk2** into a small cup, put in the fridge.
    - Drain the dry fruit, leave on the colander to rest. May put them into the fridge, if it's too hot.
3. **Add Levain:**
    - Add the ripe **sourdough starter**.
    - Mix on low speed for **3–5 minutes**, then medium for another **3–5 minutes**.
    - You want visible gluten structure beginning to form. Almost passes windowpane.
4. **Add Remaining Sugar and the flavorings (second half):**
    - Add in **the remaining sugar**, **honey/inverted sugar**, and **vanilla**.
    - Regain the consistency.
5. **Add Salt:**
    - Add **salt** with **1/3 of the milk from the fridge**.
    - Mix until incorporated and passes windowpane.
6. **Add Butter in Chunks:**
    - Add softened, cool butter in **5–6 additions**, waiting for full incorporation each time.
    - Scrape down sides as needed. Dough will slacken at first, then tighten again.
    - Mix until glossy, elastic, and passes the **windowpane test**.
7. **Add a bit more milk** to soften the dough:
	- If the dough can handle, add **1/3 more milk from the fridge**. 
	- Regain the consistency.
8. **Add Fruit:**
    - Pat dry the fruit briefly, add them all at once.
    - Knead a few minutes on low evenly distributed and the consistency's regained.
9. **Add the remaining milk**:
	- If the dough is super strong and stiff-ish (although soft), add **the remaining milk from the fridge** while kneading, very slowly.
	- Regain the consistency. It should slightly "kiss" the sides of the mixing bowl, sticking occasionally. If it can handle more milk, add it.
10. **Check Dough Temp:**
    - Ideally ends around **24–26°C**. If higher, refrigerate 15 min before bulk.
    - Measure the dough's weight and [[How much dough goes into the mold|calculate]] for the molds.
