1. Alpine gingerbread
2. Nuremberg gingerbread (need to finish up 220 of store-bought candied peels bought last year)
3. [[Focaccia (LM and sweet)]]
4. [[Borodinsky]] / Whole wheat sandwich bread
5. [[Tiramisu]]

Focaccia was huge (1400g) and overproofed, too many tomatoes, should've made gingerbread 1-2 weeks in advance and edit the recipe, especially the spices (done)
For Borodinsky - but actual type 1 (sifted) rye flour to make it later + do not underproof
Didn't make Tiramisu due to tiredness (gingerbread) and the absence of a hand mixer (in service)
