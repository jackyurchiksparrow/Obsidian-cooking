Recipes:
1. The [[Cinnamon rolls]] recipe is taken at 1kg of dough and made into a poppy seed roll with 500g of filling.
2. [[Graham whole wheat]] loaf (843g)

both fermented in 8 hours, hence the set

The seeds weren't old so I just poured hot milk over the seeds, covered and let it rest for 60min, grinded and added everything else.

11:40: feed LM 40g starter : 39g water : 80g white bread flour for 4 hours at 28C *(brod and taylor)*
12:00~12:30: poppy seed filling (soak), grind, cook, cool *(smaller sauce pan)*
13:00 get the butter out of the fridge
14:30: graham loaf autolyze with COLD water *(bowl of a stand mixer)*
15:40: Ripe LM (fermentolyze for cinnamon roll dough) *(wide bowl)* while the graham loaf is kneading
- measure the initial volume of both doughs
- graham goes into a *wide bowl* instead of sweet dough and ferments at 24C *brod and taylor*, then graham goes into *1L plastic tall* until bulk is done (50%)
- sweet roll dough stays *in the bowl of a stand mixer* during stretches and folds and ferments in a *cloth bag* at 24C and then goes into a *bigger 2.5 plastic tall container* until bulk is done, then fill

shape and refrigerate both and bake in the morning next day
