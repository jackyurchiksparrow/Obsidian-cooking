1. Do not create any h6 elements. (if using script.js)
2. Do not create any tables. First table is for the image gallery. Second - for ingredients upscaling. (if using script.js; also styles are unpredictable)
3. All images are clickable for scaling (only in the reading mode; works only with script.js)
4. Scaling ingredients doesn't work in the reading mode. On the contrary to this downside, scaled results won't be saved in next sessions.
