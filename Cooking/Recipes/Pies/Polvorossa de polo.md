## Directions:

#### Filling

1. Soak the raisins.
2. Make the [[Chicken stock]].
3. If using mushrooms, chop them into quarters and dry-cook them.
4. Finely chop leeks, onions, shallots / spring onions, celery and chilies. Let them sauté in the olive oil on low.
5. Add red-bell peppers and carrots, finely chopped.
6. Add garlic.
7. Add tomato paste and palm sugar (optional), caramelize.
8. Add wine, cook it out.
9. Add tomatoes. Cook.
10. Add the mushrooms / meat, mustard, soy sauce. Cook.
11. Add the soaked raisins, olives, capers. Mix. If the filling is too dry, add water. 
12. Check for the seasoning.
13. Cool and let it sit in the fridge overnight.

#### Dough

1. Make the dough, cool overnight having divided into 2 parts (1/3 and 2/3).

#### Assembly and baking

1. Grease the mold, flour it. Roll the 2/3 dough for the bottom.
2. Add the pickles to the filling, mix.
3. Place the filling into the mold.
4. Roll the 1/3 dough, cover, seal, make the marks with a fork (for steam circulation; the filling is very dense) and bake for 40-50 minutes at 190C or until golden brown. Let it cook slightly before serving so the pieces will stay together.
