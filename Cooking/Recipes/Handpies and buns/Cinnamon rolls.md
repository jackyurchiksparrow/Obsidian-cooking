## Directions:

### The dough

1. Add the egg, sourdough starter, and sugar to the bowl. Mix to combine. Slowly pour in the milk mixture. Add the flour and salt. Continue mixing until a rough, sticky dough forms. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. And knead to develop some strength 5-7 minutes. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes.  
2. In 30 minute intervals perform at least 4 stretches and folds.  
3. Bulk ferment the dough. Overnight or about 8 hours or until it's bubbly and doubled and doomed.

### Filling:
1. Melt the butter slowly and let it cool so it doesn't melt the sugar.
2. Mix the sugar and cinnamon.

### Assembling:
1. Roll the dough into a rectangle.
2. Brush the melted butter.
3. Distribute the cinnamon filling.
4. Roll into a log, cut into about 16 buns.

### Baking
