## Directions:

1. In a large bowl, rub together the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Set aside.
2. Using a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream butter and brown sugar on medium speed until fluffy, about 3 to 5 minutes Add in the molasses, then the egg and vanilla, and mix until combined. Scrape the bowl down and mix once more.
3. With the mixer running on low speed, gradually add in the flour mixture gradually until a nice dough forms.
4. Divide the dough in half and shape into disks. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for about 4 hours or overnight. (This step is important because the dough gets soft quickly and is very sticky when soft, so it really needs to be thoroughly chilled.)
5. When you’re ready to bake, preheat the oven to 180°C. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
6. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disc of chilled dough at a time to about 6mm in thickness. Dip the cookie cutter shapes of your choice in flour and cut out as many as you can. Carefully transfer each cutout to a baking sheet, leaving an inch between them. Reroll the scraps once.
7. Bake the cookies one sheet at a time for 10 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
