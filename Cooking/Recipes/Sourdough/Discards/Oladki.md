## Directions:

### Batter

Combine the wet and dry ingredients EXCEPT for the baking powder and baking soda. Whisk well, cover and chill overnight (keep in mind that the mixture will increase in volume overnight). The next day, sift the powders directly over the bowl and whisk again to combine.**The consistency should be very thick, bubbly. It should drop off the spoon in big chunks**. Add extra liquid, 1 tbsp. at a time, to thin out the texture if needed. Let the batter sit for at least 5 minutes to aerate; it should be nice and bubbly before using. The batter can be used cold. 

### Cooking

1. Preheat the pan to max and then reduce heat slightly. Apply a tiny bit of oil with a paper towel.
2. Pour the batter into the center. Cover with a lid.
3. When bubble formation starts stopping and some larger bubbles appear, turn them over. Cook with no lid. Done.
