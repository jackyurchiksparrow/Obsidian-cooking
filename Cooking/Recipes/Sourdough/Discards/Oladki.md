## Directions:

### Batter

**For thick and fluffy pancakes:** Combine the wet and dry ingredients EXCEPT for the baking powder and baking soda. Whisk well, cover and chill overnight. The next day, sift the powders directly over the bowl and whisk again to combine. The texture should be thick, bubbly, and pourable. Add extra milk, 1 tbsp. at a time, to thin out the texture if needed. Let the batter sit for at least 5 minutes to aerate; it should be nice and bubbly before using. The batter can be used cold. 

> Heat the milk slightly and soak the stiff starter, then homogenize it.

> Be careful! The batter will have risen overnight by ~30%. Keep in mind when choosing a jar/bowl.

**For thin and fluffy pancakes:** Add all of the ingredients together and chill overnight. No need to add the leavening agents separately.

### Cooking

1. Preheat the pan to max and then reduce heat slightly.
2. Pour the batter into the center and distribute all over the pan. Cover with a lid.
3. When bubble formation starts stopping and some larger bubbles appear, turn them over. Cook with no lid. Done.
