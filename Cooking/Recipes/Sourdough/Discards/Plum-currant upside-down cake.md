## Directions:


1. Wash and dry the fruit.
2. Combine flour, discard, baking powder and salt; set aside.
3. Beat the white sugar and the butter (leave a few tablespoons for later) in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in egg, then stir in vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture, alternately with milk, mixing just until incorporated.
4. Combine brown sugar, 3 tablespoons of butter from the overall quantity in the prepared pan and cinnamon. Place pan on heat until butter melts and begins to bubble.
5. Meanwhile, arrange plums in the pan, alternating with the berries, overlapping slightly. Cook until boils.
6. Pour batter into prepared pan, covering fruit completely.
7. Bake for 40 minutes at 180C or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool 15 minutes before serving.
