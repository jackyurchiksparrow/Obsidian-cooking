## Directions:

1. Make the [[Tangzhong]] in advance (could also make overnight) to let it cool completely before adding to the dough.
2. To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, add the tangzhong, flour, sugar, water, salt, and ripe levain. Mix on low speed for 1 to 2 minutes until combined. Increase the mixer speed to medium and mix for 5 to 6 minutes until the dough begins to cling to the dough hook, but it doesn’t completely clear the sides of the mixing bowl. 
3. Let the dough rest in the bowl, covered, for 10 minutes.
4. With the mixer running on low speed, add the butter, one pat at a time, until absorbed into the dough, scraping down the sides of the bowl and the dough hook as needed. Continue until all the butter is added, 5 to 8 minutes. Increase the speed to medium and mix for 1 to 2 minutes more, until the dough smooths out and clings to the dough hook once again. The dough will be silky smooth, elastic, and a little shiny. Transfer to a container for bulk fermentation.
5. When the dough has risen significantly, divide it into 12 pieces of 105g each.
6. Shape each piece of dough into a tight ball.
7. Line the tray with a parchment paper. Place the balls onto a baking tray for a final proof. Use the [[Poke test]] to assess their readiness.
8. Remove the parchment with buns from the tray. Place it in the middle position and preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
9. Make the egg wash by whisking together the egg and 1 tablespoon milk. Using a pastry brush, brush the wash evenly on top of the dough. If desired, lightly sprinkle seeds of your choice over the rolls.
10. Slide the buns onto a hot baking pan. Place the baking pan into the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees and reduce the temperature to 350°F (175°C). Bake for 20 minutes more, or until the internal temperature reaches 204°F (95°C) and the crust is golden and shiny.
11. Let the buns cool for 5 minutes on the sheet pans. Then transfer to a wire rack to cool for 1 hour. If you cut the buns too early (or eat one straight off the sheet pan), they may be excessively soft. These will keep well for 3 to 4 days covered and on the counter.

> HOT DOG BUNS
This dough makes amazing hot dog buns. Divide the dough into 9 pieces of 130g
each, shape into 4-inch-long bâtards, and line them up side by
side in a long rectangular baking pan. Before baking, brush the dough with the
egg wash. If desired, sprinkle with white sesame seeds.
