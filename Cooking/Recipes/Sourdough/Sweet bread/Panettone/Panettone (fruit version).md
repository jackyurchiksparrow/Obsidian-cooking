## Directions:

### Refreshments:
0. Take a stiff starter and feed it with warm water (31C). Mix thoroughly until bubbly and cloudy. Add the room temperature flour and knead for 7 minutes, until smooth. The dough temperature must be 26-27C. Shape into a ball, make a crisscross on top for the temperature to penetrate uniformly and place into a plastic bag for 4 hours at 26-27C. Each time 4 hours if the temp is correct:
FR: 20:00: **Regular refreshment aiming for the peak: 6 sourdough starter: 15 water: 30 white flour** (50% hydration) 1:5 feeding; (discard everything else)
ST 8:30: **1st refreshment ratio: 12 sourdough starter: 12 water: 24 white flour** (50% hydration) 1:2 feeding; (discard 20 g)
ST 12:30: **2nd refreshment ratio: 28 sourdough starter: 21 water: 42 white flour** (50% hydration) 1:1.5 feeding; (no discard)
ST 16:30: **3rd refreshment ratio: 91 sourdough starter: 38 water: 76 white flour** (50% hydration) 1:0.83 feeding; (no discard)

### First kneading (ST 20:30):
1. Put the flour in a mixer together with the butter, sourdough starter torn into pieces, the water at 31-32ºC. Start mixing slowly until the mixture isn't yet gathered, but all ingredients are more or less even. Now add the sugar. Knead for ~15 minutes or until the dough is tenacious (the gluten is developed).
2. Now the dough must look smooth, glossy, detached from the walls, not too dry, not too wet. Add the egg yolks all at once. The goal now is to return to the initial consistency, but it will be slightly more wet and sticky. It will first start to break down, that's OK. When the yolks are mixed in slightly, we may increase the speed to medium.
3. Take the dough out from the mixer onto the counter. Fold it a few times to form a strong big boule.
4. Wait until it quadruples in size (8-13h) at 26C. The more it takes and not accelerated with higher temperatures, the more preservation time we have, the more moisture retainment longevity. 8h - 2 weeks, 12-13h - 3 weeks/up to 1 month. It still must be safe to eat even after 3 weeks, but it won't be perfect.

> Once the fermentation time has passed, place it in the refrigerator before proceeding to the second kneading. This step will make the dough easier to handle.

6. Make the [[Chocolate glaze|Chocolate glaze]] and place into the fridge overnight.
7. Soak the dry fruit overnight in minimum amount of cold water. Then, in the morning, dry them thoroughly. DO NOT soak candied peeks, or just a handful, soaking will take some aroma. It is better to cover them with inverted syrup or oil. Same for the chocolate chips.
### Second kneading:
1. Degas the first dough in the hand mixer on low.
2. Add the flour all at once, but careful. Aim for strength and structure (4-5 min). This is the most crucial step. All the flour must be incorporated and well-kneaded into the dough without adding any other ingredients at this step. (When the flour is slightly mixed in, increase the speed a bit). In the end, the dough must not stick to the walls (almost at least), be shiny and glossy, pass the window pane test.
3. Add all the sugar with 1/3 of egg yolks. The yolks will moisturize the sugar, making it softer and more easily accessible for the dough.
4. When the dough has regained its consistency again, add the inverted sugar / honey with another 1/3 of the egg yolks all at once. This will again help to dissolve the inverted sugar. Work the dough until homogeneous again.
5. Add the fine salt with the remaining 1/3 egg yolk. Regain the texture working for a few minutes again.
6. Add all the butter at once. Recover the dough again.
7. Add the water very slowly, time to time. Let it be fully absorbed by the dough.
8. Now, choose what panettone to make: fruit / chocolate / pistachio etc.

### Fruit panettone

9. Add vanilla seeds / orange zest / lemon zest freshly grated. Mix 2 to 3 min.
10. Add the candied orange / ginger / lemon with raisins all at once. The fruit must be moist. Either soaked and drained all oiled or in syrup. Mix 2 to 3 minutes.
11. Take the dough out of the machine and rest it for an hour or half on a flat OILED surface, uncovered.
12. Divide into portions folding each piece once with one hand while dividing the rest. Each mold must contain precisely 1/3 grams of its volume. If a mold fits 1.5 L of water, we will need to use 500 g of dough.
13. Make three folds for each dough piece and then round with a scraper. Set aside for 30 min.
14. Round them again, place into molds. Always keep the upper part of the dough on top. It is not sticky.
15. If the dough is at 26C, and the environment too; 8 hour proof having covered each with a plastic wrap. 

> Each degree below will make us wait 1 hour more. Each degree above may melt the butter too much. It is done when the dough is almost near the edges of the molds.
### Baking

16. Apply the glaze on top, but not the edges, just wait until it's spread there.
17. Top with coarse sugar.
18. Bake 35 minutes 170 C NO FAN until it's 96C inside. Fan is fine, but then it's 155C.
19. Hang them upside down overnight (the chef said it's fine to just wait until they have cooled to 28C). Do it fast before they collapse.
