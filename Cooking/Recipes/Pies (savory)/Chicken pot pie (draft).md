## Directions:

#### Filling

1. Soak the raisins.
2. Make the [[Chicken stock]].
3. Cut into two bowls. 
   First bowl: leeks, onions, shallots / spring onions, parsley stalks. 
   Second bowl: bell peppers, carrots, celery, fennel, chilies
4. First bowl in: sauté in the olive oil until translucent
5. Second bow in: fry off
6. Add garlic. Cook until the smell changes
7. Add tomato paste and palm sugar (omit the sugar), caramelize.
8. Add wine, cook it out.
9. Add tomatoes + soda (optional). Cook.
10. Add mustard and soy sauce.
11. Add the stock. Cook until almost completely reduced.
12. Add the meat. Cook and adjust the moisture content.
13. Add the soaked raisins, olives, capers (if using). Mix. If the filling is too dry, add more water/stock.  
14. Check for the seasoning.
15. Cool and let it sit in the fridge overnight.

#### Dough

1. Make the dough, cool overnight having divided into 2 parts (1/3 and 2/3).

#### Assembly and baking

1. Grease the mold, flour it. Roll the 2/3 dough for the bottom.
2. Add the pickles to the filling, mix.
3. Place the filling into the mold.
4. Roll the 1/3 dough, cover, seal, make the marks with a fork (for steam circulation; the filling is very dense) and bake for 40-50 minutes at 190C or until golden brown. Let it cook slightly before serving so the pieces will stay together.
