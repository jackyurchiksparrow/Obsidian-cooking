## Fast glaze

1. Mix the confectioners sugar and water/milk/citrus/juice until the desired consistency is reached. It will crystallize and harden into a brittle shell.

## Longer soft glaze
1. Prepare the glaze by melting the sugar in the orange juice and allow to simmer for a few minutes, just until the liquid has a syrupy consistency. This method keeps the glaze more frosting-like and soft, with a shiny finish, but it won’t crystallize or harden into a brittle shell.

## Egg-white glaze (royal icing)

Ingredients: 
• 2 pasteurized egg whites or 1/4 cup pasteurized liquid egg whites 
• 3/4 tsp cream of tartar 
• 3 cup powdered sugar 
• Food coloring (if desired) 
• 1 1/2 tsp water (if needed)

- In the bowl of a stand mixer or large mixing bowl, beat egg whites on medium-low speed until frothy, about 1 minute.
    
- With the mixer on low speed, slowly add in confectioners’ sugar and vanilla.
    
- Once fully incorporated, increase speed to medium-high and beat until stiff peaks shiny peaks form.
    
- Divide icing among small bowls, and dye with gel food coloring if desired. (Keep any icing that isn’t being immediately used covered with plastic wrap as it dries out very quickly.) Transfer to piping bags and decorate cookies.
