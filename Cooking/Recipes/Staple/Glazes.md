## Fast glaze

1. Mix the confectioners sugar and water/milk/citrus/juice until the desired consistency is reached. It will crystallize and harden into a brittle shell.

## Longer soft glaze
1. Prepare the glaze by melting the sugar in the orange juice and allow to simmer for a few minutes, just until the liquid has a syrupy consistency. This method keeps the glaze more frosting-like and soft, with a shiny finish, but it won’t crystallize or harden into a brittle shell.
