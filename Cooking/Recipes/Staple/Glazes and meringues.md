## Glaze that hardens (takes little time)

1. Mix the confectioners sugar and water/milk/citrus/juice until the desired consistency is reached. It will crystallize and harden into a brittle shell.

## Soft glaze (takes longer)
1. Prepare the glaze by melting the sugar in the orange juice and allow to simmer for a few minutes, just until the liquid has a syrupy consistency. This method keeps the glaze more frosting-like and soft, with a shiny finish, but it won’t crystallize or harden into a brittle shell. 

## Neutral glaze

## Egg-white glaze (royal icing; hardens)

Ingredients: 
• 3 pasteurized egg whites or 1/4 cup pasteurized liquid egg whites 
• salt 
• 450 g powdered sugar 
• Food coloring (if desired) 
• 1 1/2 tsp water (if needed)

- In the bowl of a stand mixer or large mixing bowl, beat egg whites on medium-low speed until frothy, about 1 minute.
- With the mixer on low speed, slowly add in confectioners’ sugar and vanilla.
- Once fully incorporated, increase speed to medium-high and beat until stiff peaks shiny peaks form.
- Divide icing among small bowls, and dye with gel food coloring if desired. (Keep any icing that isn’t being immediately used covered with plastic wrap as it dries out very quickly.) Transfer to piping bags and decorate cookies.

## Swiss meringue (takes long; doesn't harden, soft, safe)

• 120 g egg whites (~4 egg whites)
• 216 g sugar (ratio sugar : egg whites = 1.8)
• 1/4 tsp. salt
• lemon juice
• vanilla

1. Cook whites, sugar and salt to 72C on !Baine Marie. 
	**Very important!  The foam created by heat on the surface won't let you use remote thermometer so opt for using regular**
2. Add lemon juice, whip on high immediately. !Use stand mixer!
3. Add vanilla, mix.

## Italian meringue (syrup + egg white; wonderful and crispy when baked or torched; more stable than the Swiss)

- 30g water
- 117g sugar
- 65g egg whites
- 15g lemon juice (optional)
- 1.5g gelatin (it will help hold it together for longer; just an additional stabilizer; optional)

① Bloom the gelatin in ice-cold water.
② Make 118℃ sugar syrup by boiling water(30g) and sugar (117g). 
③ Meanwhile, at the same time, whip the egg white (65g) and sugar (25g) to make a French meringue. 
④ Pour the sugar syrup into the French meringue and continue to whip. 
⑤ Melt the lemon juice + gelatin mixture using a microwave and add this in. 
⑥ Whip until the Italian meringue cools down to room temp. 
⑦ Store it in the fridge if not used immediately.

## Agar "Bird's milk" glaze (not too long to cook, soft, stabilizes quickly, top dries quickly, possible to break during a tough transportation)

• 60g egg white (~ 2 medium-sized pcs.)
• 100g sugar + 10g vanilla sugar
• 55g water for syrup 
• 4g agar-agar 
• 16g (to hydrate agar)
• Pinch of salt 
• ~½ tsp acid (e.g. lemon juice or 1g citric acid)

### Only make it before using, it hardens quickly! Make sure everything is set up to be glazed.
1. Combine water, sugar and vanilla sugar for syrup, begin heating gently.
2. Meanwhile, soak agar in the water. Let sit 10 min to bloom.
3. Start whipping egg whites with salt and acid until medium-stiff stiff peaks. Start this while syrup is still <100°C.
4. Once the sugar syrup starts boiling (~100°C), add the bloomed agar-agar to it.  Stir constantly to avoid burning or sticking. Bring the mixture to **106–110°C** — agar must fully activate here. Bubbles will be large and slower at this point.Add the agar to the syrup, mix and cook all the time. Prevent it from sticking to the bottom.
5. Immediately begin **pouring the hot agar syrup in a thin stream** into the whipping egg whites (keep the mixer on medium-high).  Aim at the side of the bowl to avoid splattering. As soon as it cools down, it thickens. Whip until it's slightly thickens (**about 45–50°C**), then glaze. If you have a lot to glaze, put the bowl ON the pot of boiling water (bain-marie style) to prevent it from hardening too fast. Apply decorations immediately.
