## Directions:

1. Pick a stainless steel pan. (This will help you see when the butter has actually turned brown as it is easy to burn it.  )
2. Get the butter into the pan (note that some liquid will evaporate). It is recommended to use unsalted as salt contributes to more foaming, which makes it harder to see the color under the foam.  
3. Medium-high heat (gas stove). Swirl the pan occasionally to ensure butter melts and cooks evenly. When it begins to foam that's a clue for you that it's nearly done.  
4. When the foam subsides, keep stirring the bits on the bottom (milk solids, they are very important and give the most flavor) to keep them from sticking (not to burn them).  
5. As soon as the butter turns chestnut brown and gives a nutty aroma, remove it from the pan (it can still burn from the residual heat of the pan) and measure the output.
