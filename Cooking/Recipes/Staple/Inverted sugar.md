> [!tip] The water will have evaporated by the time the syrup is ready, so to calculate the overall volume, consider only sugar (more or less). Also, it is best to brush the sides of the port from sugar because some crystals may get into the storing jar while pouring the syrup, which may cause crystallization.

## Directions:

1. Don't forget [[Inverted sugar (theory)|the theory]].
2. Mix sugar and water in a sauce pan with a thick bottom. Bring to a rolling boil.
3. Add the lemon juice / citric acid and stir.
4. The syrup is ready when it is at the soft ball stage (112-115C). You may also do a thread test, when you cool a drop of the syrup and try if it produces a thread between two fingers. (The remote thermometer was showing 110C, when it was ready).
5. Allow to cool for a few minutes and then pour into a jar. It will last for 2+ years, but may crystallize in 6 month. Store in the fridge.
