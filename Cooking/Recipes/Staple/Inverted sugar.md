| - do not use high heat after boiling<br>- do not add more water than it is needed to moisten the sugar<br>- do remember to brush the sides before all crystals are completely melted<br>- do not store in the fridge, it will crystallize so bad |     |     |     |

> [!tip] The water will have evaporated by the time the syrup is ready, so to calculate the overall volume, consider only sugar (more or less). Also, it is best to brush the sides of the port from sugar because some crystals may get into the storing jar while pouring the syrup, which may cause crystallization.

## Directions:

1. Don't forget [[Inverted sugar (theory)|the theory]].
2. Mix sugar and water in a sauce pan with a thick bottom. Bring to a rolling boil.
3. Add the lemon juice / citric acid and stir. Reduce the heat to low.
4. The syrup is ready when it is at the soft ball stage (112-115C). You may also do a thread test, when you cool a drop of the syrup and try if it produces a thread between two fingers. (The remote thermometer was showing 110C, when it was ready).
5. Allow to cool for a few minutes and then pour into a jar. It will last for 2+ years, but may crystallize in 6 month. Store on the counter
