## Directions:

1. Trim the top and bottom of the fruit. Peel them with a knife while rotating.
2. Trim the excess white pith if any, but leave some, the stripes must be thick.
3. Cut them into thick strips. 
4. Bring water to a rolling boil and boil them for 15 minutes three times, changing the water and rinsing the peels with cold water.
5. Combine the sugar, orange juice, water, inverted sugar and bring to a boil. Throw the peels in. Cook with a lid  on LOW (not to turn it into a candy) about 60-90 minutes. They are ready, when:
 - they are translucent and soft
 - the syrup has became lightly syrupy (on a candy thermometer this will be be approximately soft ball stage - 112-115C)
 6. Allow to cool and either dry or pour into a jar with the syrup (providing that they are fully submerged in it and store in the fridge for up to 6 months).
