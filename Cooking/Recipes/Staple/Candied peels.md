```dataviewjs
while (!customJS?.state?._ready) { 
	await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50)); 
} 

const {RecipeScaler} = await cJS();
RecipeScaler.RecipeScaler();

window.onerror = function (message, source, lineno, colno, error) {
	if (error instanceof TypeError && message.includes("Cannot read properties of undefined")) {

```
**Tips and mistakes:**
> 1. Peeler used, but it makes too thin slices. It is better to use a knife or the peels will not have the texture.
> 2. When removing the bottom parts, also blanch them with the peels to then make [[Dehydrated candied citrus]].
> 3. Do not cut the pieces into strips as they will be harder to manage.

## Directions:

### Preparation

1. **Wash the Fruit**: Thoroughly clean the oranges using a sponge or brush.
2. **Prepare the Peels**:
    - Trim the top and bottom of the fruit.
    - Use a knife to peel the fruit, keeping the strips thick enough without cutting too deeply.
    - Remove excess white pith, but leave some to maintain thickness.
3. **Remove Stems**: Discard the stems from the trimmed top and bottom pieces.

### Boiling the peels

4. **Blanch the Peels**:
    - Bring water to a rolling boil and boil all the peels (including tops and bottoms) for **15 minutes**.
    - Repeat this process **three times**, changing the water and rinsing the peels with cold water each time.

### #### **Making Candied Orange Peels**

5. **Prepare the Syrup**:
    - Combine sugar, orange juice, water, and [[Inverted Sugar]] in a pot.
    - Bring the mixture to a boil, then add the peels (excluding the tops and bottoms).
6. **Cook the Peels**:
    - Simmer on **low heat** for **60-90 minutes** with a lid to prevent turning the peels into candy.
    - The peels are done when:
        - They appear translucent and soft.
        - The syrup thickens slightly (around **112-115°C**, "soft ball" stage).
7. **Cool and Store**:
	  - Let the peels cool.
	- Either dry them or store in jars fully submerged in syrup (for up to **6 months in the fridge**). Note: This method is suitable for small batches.

###  **Orange Marmalade and Dried Slices**

8. **Slice the Fruit**:
    - Thinly slice the oranges.
    - Reserve ugly slices and juice for [[Orange Marmalade]]. Keep about **2 trays** of thin, beautiful slices for drying.
9. **Make Marmalade**:
    - After the peels are done, add the reserved ugly slices, tops, and bottoms to the pot.
    - Add [[Inverted Sugar]], sugar, and enough juice to cover everything.
    - Add a pinch of salt.
    - Cook while stirring occasionally until the pieces are tender and sweet. **Do not stop stirring**, as the bottom of the pan can burn.

### **Drying Slices**

10. **Bake the Slices**:
    - Cover both sides of the beautiful slices with sugar.
    - Arrange them as follows:
        - **Tray → Parchment Paper → Sugared Slices → Parchment Paper → Another Tray to push them down.**
    - Bake at **120°C for 15 minutes**. Pat dry the juices (or save them for the marmalade). Repeat for the second batch.
11. **Final Drying**:
    - Using both trays, dry the slices at **80°C with a fan** for **2-4 hours**, until completely dried.
