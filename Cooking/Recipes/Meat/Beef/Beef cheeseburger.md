## Directions:

1. Finely chop the onions and garlic, add to the beef. Add the egg yolk(s), salt, pepper, ... Now mix with a wooden spoon. **DO NOT overmix the meat and DO NOT push the balls together TOO HARD when forming patties! The more proteins are compacted together, the more juices will be pushed out during baking! The less you handle the beef, the more tender they are going to be.**
2. Form LIGHTLY into a ball and then pat them down with your hand gently. 
3. Bake them 220 C for 10 minutes (summer house) or until [[Beef cooking chart temperatures|the temperature]] is about 66C. (They will continue to cook to 70C well-done when they are after the oven).
4. Assemble. Toast the bun on a dry pan (optional). Bun -> sauce -> onions -> patty -> cheese -> pickles -> lettuce -> tomatoes -> salt -> (second patty with cheese) -> sauce -> bun.
