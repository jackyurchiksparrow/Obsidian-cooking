> [!Tip] **DO NOT overmix the meat and DO NOT push the balls together TOO HARD when forming patties! The more proteins are compacted together, the more juices will be pushed out during baking! The less you handle the beef, the more tender they are going to be.** 
> 
> **Why Some Disagree:**
> - Some cooks prefer firmer, uniform patties for specific recipes (like smash burgers), which may tolerate more mixing or compression.
> - Others argue that fat content and cooking technique (like not overcooking) can mitigate the effects of overhandling.

## Directions:

1. Mix all the ingredients. Mix with a wooden spoon, do not squeeze or mash the mixture. **DO NOT overmix the meat and DO NOT push the balls together TOO HARD when forming patties! The more proteins are compacted together, the more juices will be pushed out during baking! The less you handle the beef, the more tender they are going to be.**
2. Form LIGHTLY (but firmly just enough) into a ball and then pat them down with your hand gently onto the baking sheet. 
3. Broil them on max for 10 minutes (summer house) or until they are nicely browned.
4. Get them out, cover with foil, reduce the temperature to 200C and cook until [[Beef cooking chart temperatures|the temperature]] is about 66C. (They will continue to cook to 70C well-done when they are after the oven).
5. Assemble. Toast the bun on a dry pan (optional). Bun -> sauce -> onions -> patty -> cheese -> pickles -> lettuce -> tomatoes -> salt -> (second patty with cheese) -> sauce -> bun.
