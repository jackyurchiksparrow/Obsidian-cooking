| Adjustments:<br>- don't use green parts of leeks, they make it green<br>- cook the meat for longer before adding rice<br>- change the pan, I had to stir too frequently and the rice was sort of lumpy<br>- rice was also dry-ish because water couldn't properly cover it and frequent stirring got on the way |     |     |     |     |

> [!Tip] The pan is ridiculous, the rice burns quickly before it's cooked through.

## Directions:

1. Measure and soak the dry fruit in cold water.
2. Finely chop onions, celery and fennel, cut carrots into long thin strips.
3. Cut meat into smaller pieces (smaller than you think).
4. Heat the pan and add olive oil to cover the bottom. Add the meat and salt; cook and wait for the water to evaporate (~20-30 min).
5. Measure and wash the rice thoroughly, let it drain.
6. Prepare the pilaf spice mix. Prepare the spices for rice.
7. Add the spices to meat.
	**My trick**: If it's been a while and the water is still there and meat is cooked enough, then add 1/2 cup of the washed rice and let it soak the water. Now, proceed.
8. Brown the meat, add vegetables, olive oil, season with salt and spices. Cook.
9. When the carrots are soften, add the rice and cook.
10. Add the water and spices. Close the lid, another 20-30 minutes.
11. Taste and season.
12. Add the dry fruit, another 1-2 minutes. Done.
