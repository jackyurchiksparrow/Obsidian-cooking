## Directions:

1. Tie the shanks tightly with string up to the waist. Season each side with salt and pepper. Leave in the fridge overnight uncovered if possible. 
2. Chop the carrots, celery and onion.
3. Fry the meat until golden brown, set aside. In the same pan, fry the vegetables in a mixture of olive oil and butter until translucent.
4. Make a hole in the center and fry the tomato paste until the smell changes. Stir.
5. Pour in the wine/water, getting rid of the smell of alcohol.
6. Add the bay leaves, thyme and rosemary, black peppercorns in a parcel. Bring to a simmer. Add salt and pepper to taste. 
7. Place the shanks on a baking sheet and pour in the sauce. Add broth/water. The meat should cover up to the waist.
8. Put in the oven at 160 degrees, covering with foil. After 10 minutes, reduce to 120 and simmer for 3-4 hours, turning the meat every hour.
9. Mix parsley, olive oil, lemon juice and zest in a mortar, crush. Add finely chopped garlic and serve the meat with gremolata. And potatoes or rice.
