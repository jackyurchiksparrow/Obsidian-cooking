## Directions:

### Dough

1. Hydrate the discard with the warm water. Let it hydrate for 20–30 minutes. This prevents it from “stealing” water from the dough, which could make the pastry tough or crumbly.
2. In a big bowl, mix the dry ingredients together (flour, sugar and salt). 
3. Melt the butter over low heat, and lightly warm the milk.
4. In a small bowl, mix the egg yolks, melted butter, milk, vanilla, and sourdough mixture in a bowl.
5. Add the wet ingredients into the bowl with your flour and begin kneading the dough until the dough it is smooth, and does not stick to your hands.
6. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it sit for 30 minutes in a room temperature. The dough should not rise, otherwise your Shekerbura will lose its pattern during baking.

### Filling

 1. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. Blend the nuts, not too finely, using a food processor. 
 2. Remove the nuts from the blender and mix them with the sugar, the ground cardamom and vanilla / rum.

### Dough (part 2)

7. Divide the dough into small balls (35g). Place the balls on a plate, cover it with plastic wrap (place them in the refrigerator to prevent from rising if you use active levain and pull them out 5 at a time while you make each Shekerbura).
8. Roll out the ball into a circle approximately 2-3 mm thick and 8-10 cm wide.  
9. Place a tablespoon of the stuffing in the center. Fold and pinch the ends tightly, then twist them as you would the edges of a Cornish pasty.  
10. With your maggash (special tweezers), start pinching the dough to decorate the surface of Shekerbura.
11. Place each ready-to-cook Shekerbura on a cold baking sheet (one inch from each other) until you finish 8-10 of them.
### Baking
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and bake Shekerbura for approximately 20 minutes, until the bottom is slightly golden-brown, and the top is light.  Serve Shekerbura warm.
