Tiramisu  
  
1kg Mascarpone  
900 g whipping cream  
226 g egg yolk (11-12 yolks)  
213 g sugar  
93 g water  
Strong coffee  
  
① Lightly beat the mascarpone cheese.  
② Add the heavy cream in and beat it until you reach the desired consistency (not too soft). Keep this in the fridge while you work on the pâté à bombe.  
③ Pâté à bombe: Add egg yolk + water + sugar in a saucepan and raise it to 85℃ using a hot water bath. I recommend straining it. Whip it until you get a light yellow colour.  
④ Add the pâté à bombe to the mascarpone & heavy cream that we’ve whipped earlier. Mix everything well and whip it again until you get a stiffer consistency.  
⑤ Pour it over the coffee syrup soaked lady fingers.  
⑥ Let it chill/set in the fridge for at least 3~4hrs.  
⑦ Dust it with cocoa powder and serve!
