## Directions:

0. Remember [[Cupcakes (theory)]] theory.
### Dough

1. While you're making the dough, wash the orange and boil it for 30 minutes.
2. Place the discard, sugar and eggs in a large bowl and beat with a mixer until light and fluffy. (Or rub the starter with flour first if it's stiff).
3. Sift the flour with the baking powder then add to the mixture in the bowl a little at a time along with the softened butter. Continue to mix until completely blended, then stir in the yogurt.
4. Get the orange, remove the seeds. In a food processor, process the whole orange until it is almost pureed. 
5. Add this orange to the cake mixture along with the vanilla and stir until evenly combined, then put the batter into the prepared tin. Should be pretty stiff. Wait for an hour.
6. Bake for 50-60 minutes (depending on your oven) 180 C until the skewer comes out clean to make sure the orange cake is done before removing from the oven. Allow to cool for about 15 minutes, then remove the side of the springform pan if it's not silicon.

### Make the glaze

1. [[Glazes and meringues|Make the glaze]]
2. Spoon and brush over the top of the cake and allow to cool completely before cutting.
