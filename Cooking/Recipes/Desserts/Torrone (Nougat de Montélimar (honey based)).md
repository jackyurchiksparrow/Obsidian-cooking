## Directions:
### --- Honey French-style nougat ---
- **Prepare a 50/50 mix of powdered sugar-cornstarch OR wafer papers** and a sieve. 
- Also, get a mold. Recommended pan size:  
    👉 **20×25 cm** (8×10”) rectangular pan → yields ~3.2 cm height  
    👉 Alternative: **22×30 cm** (larger, yields thinner pieces)
    **Tip:**✳️ Don’t go taller than 4 cm. The center may not set evenly, and the weight will compact the bottom before setting.
- EITHER dust the whatever mold you're using (better not be tall) with the powdered sugar-cornstarch mix **very generously** OR place a piece of wafer paper on the bottom.
- **Start whipping**:
    - Begin whipping egg whites, salt, and 5 g sugar on low-medium speed until **soft to firm peaks** form.
- **Start both syrups at the same time:**
    - In **saucepan 1**, GENTLY START HEATING the **honey** to **130°C**.
    - In **saucepan 2**, GENTLY START HEATING the **sugar + water + corn syrup**.
    - **Tip**: Stir sugar syrup _only until dissolved_, then stop stirring to avoid crystallization.
- **When the whites are ready, increase heat for the honey syrup to full blast, until it hits ~130°C:**
    - **Slowly drizzle** the honey into the whipped egg whites **while the mixer is running** at high speed.
    - This will gently cook and stabilize the meringue.
    - Keep whisking until it's stable enough and not soupy.
    - **Tip**: don't try to use a remote thermometer on this mixture as it will foam a lot.
- **When the mixture looks stable:**
	- Increase the sugar syrup to full blast until it hits **~145°C**. (**CRITICAL STEP:** 135°C achieves a very soft nougat. If a firmer texture is desired, heat to just below 145°C.)
    - **Immediately drizzle it** into the meringue-honey mix **in a thin stream**, again while whipping.
- Now, switch to the paddle attachment.
- **Add the inclusions** at this stage:
    - Stir it in **by hand or on low speed** until fully incorporated.
    - This gives flavor and slight chewiness without deflating the nougat.
- Spread the nougat evenly and leave to cool.
- EITHER spread it with a layer of powdered sugar-cornstarch mix again OR top with the second wafer paper glossy side up, even out with a rolling pin. 
- Leave for ~3h to cool down.
- Run an offset-spatula around the nougat to unmold. Cut and enjoy.
