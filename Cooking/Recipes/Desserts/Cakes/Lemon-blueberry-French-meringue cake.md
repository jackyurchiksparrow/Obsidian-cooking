## Plan:
Day 1:
- Sponge cake
- Blueberry puree.
- Lemon curd.
Day 2:
- Italian meringue.
- Assembling.
- Isomalt dew drops.
Day 3 (the serving day):
- finish decorating (torching and "berrying")

## Directions:

### Sponge cake:
0. Get the butter out of the fridge.
1. Beat together the wet ingredients, including the milk, sour cream, egg whites, lemon juice, zest and vanilla together in a medium bowl. Set aside
2. Into another medium bowl, sift the dry ingredients, including the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Remove two tablespoons and add it to a small bowl with the blueberries. Toss the berries to coat in flour and set aside.
3. In a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the softened butter on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed until the mixture is sandy. Stop and scrape down the bowl as needed.
4. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly pour in the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Scrape down the bowl and beat on medium-low speed until fluffy, about 30 seconds. Fold in flour-coated blueberry by hand with a spatula.
5. Divide the mixture evenly into the cake pans.
6. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the centers are springy to the touch. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 15 minutes, then remove them and place them on a wire cooling rack to cool completely.

### Blueberry puree:
1. Combine everything and bring to a boil, stirring while it thickens. Add more sugar if needed.

### Lemon curd

DO NOT USE ANYTHING METAL IN THIS. SILICON WHISK / WOODEN SPOON. NOTHING METAL / CAST IRON.
① Bloom the gelatin in ice-cold water. Rub the sugar and lemon zest together until even.
② Add the lemon juice, egg yolk, eggs, lemon sugar all into the saucepan and homogenize. Start heating up. Bring it up to a thick consistency. 
③ Add the gelatin in. 
④ Once the lemon curd cools down to 40~45℃ add in the room temp butter and blend.

### Isomalt dew drops
1. Be careful, melt a very small portion of isomalt.
2. Make small drops on a silicon mat / foil greased with oil.
3. Let it cool. Should be fine and shiny in an air-tight container for at least 3 weeks. No fridge, away from humidity.
### Assembling:
1. A sponge
2. A layer of blueberry cremeux in the center.
3. A layer of lemon mousse around.
4. Repeat.
5. Cover with Italian meringue with large waves. 
6. Torch it the day you're gonna serve. Decorate with blueberries and dew drops.
### Italian meringue:

① Bloom the gelatin in ice-cold water.
② Make 118℃ sugar syrup by boiling water and sugar1. 
③ Meanwhile, at the same time, whip the egg whites and sugar2 to make a French meringue. 
④ Pour the sugar syrup into the French meringue and continue to whip. 
⑤ Melt the lemon juice + gelatin mixture using a microwave and add this in. 
⑥ Whip until the Italian meringue cools down to room temp. 
⑦ Store it in the fridge if not used immediately.
