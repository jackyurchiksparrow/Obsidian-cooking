## Directions:

1. Weigh the sour cream and press it overnight. Put the bowl for the mousse into the fridge overnight (with the mixer whisks).
2. Soak the gelatin in cold water.
3. Put the **baking pan 28cm** on a plain plate for serving. Line it out with the strip.
4. Combine butter and cookies, pad it down into the pan. Chill.
5. Zest the oranges into a separate cup. 

### --- Orange base for the mousse ---
1. Juice the oranges into a pot. Add the sugar, salt, cinnamon stick and half of the zest. Bring to a boil and cook to reduce, about 10 min.
2. Cool slightly and add the soaked gelatin.

### --- Orange mousse---
1. Add weighed sour cream/mascarpone, sugar and heavy cream into the chilled bowl and whip until thick. Add 2/3 of warm orange base and add the second half of the zest.
2. Put 2/3 of the mousse into the pan, chill 30 min.
3. Peel the oranges with a knife, similar to an apple. Only cut out the slices without the white pith.
4. Bring sugar and water for the **orange filling** to a boil. Place the orange pulp of the desired sizes and cook until syrupy.
5. Stir it into the orange base, but do not add too much liquid. **Reserve some pulp for the decoration with mint and cinnamon**
6. Add the remaining 1/3 orange base with the pieces as a next layer. Chill for 30 min.
7. Add the remaining 1/3 of the white mouse as the last layer. Chill overnight.
