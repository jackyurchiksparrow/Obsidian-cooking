## Plan:
Day 1:
- Preparations
- Sponge cake
- (Optionally) hazelnut praline
Day 2:
- Cream and assembling
- Being decorating
Day 3 (the serving day):
- finish decorating

## Directions:

### Preparations:
1. Line two 30x40cm baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Ground a few cardamom pods, wash and dry a rosemary sprig, ground some anise seeds.
3. Prepare a silicon mat.
4. Sum up all the espresso in the recipe and brew this much. (230g is exactly two big espressos)
5. Melt and temper the chocolate for the side decoration in advance, spread it thinly onto a parchment paper, roll and freeze.
6. (Optionally) make the chocolate fish in advance, use a lot of whole nuts there! Apply some grey glitter or Candurin on top.
7. (Optionally) prepare the wafer paper.
8. Prepare the brushes for coloring and the palette.
9. Prepare the jam in advance.

### --- Chiffon sponge cake ---
1. In a smaller bowl, combine the egg whites, sugar 2 and salt, whip until stiff peaks form.
2. Using a hand mixer and a bigger bowl, whip the eggs, yolks and sugar 1 until pale and passes the ribbon test.
3. Add the cake flour, mix with a whisk by hand.
4. Add the egg whites mixture into the yolks in a few additions.
5. Spread into a layer of two 40x30cm sheets and bake 180C for about 10 minutes. Set aside to cook.

### --- Espresso syrup ---
1. Mix hot coffee and sugar. 
2. Add a small sprig of rosemary and a pinch of cardamom. 
3. Leave to cool and to dissolve the sugar.

### --- Hazelnut praline ---
1. Add sugar and a splash of water, melt into a caramel (114C).
2. Turn off the heat and add in the hazelnuts. Stir well until the sugar crystallizes completely.
3. Turn the heat back on and stir until the sugar turns into caramel (dark brown color).
4. Transfer it to a silicon mat and let it cool completely.
5. Measure the necessary amount, blend until smooth, reserve until the day you're going to use it or add it to the cream base.
6. Then add the cottage cheese into the food processor and blend again until smooth. Set aside until the say you're going to use it.

### --- Hazelnut-praline-coffee-cottage-cheese cream (Coffee mousseline cream) ---
1. **IMPORTANT** (if you are making this a day ahead, do not add the butter and cottage cheese with praline, add them the day you're going to use the cream).
2. Soak the gelatin. It helps with the texture and preservation, no specific purpose.
3. Make sure the butter is softened the same day you're going to use it.
4. Mix the yolks, sugar, salt and cornstarch in a bowl.
5. Bring espresso and milk to steaming in a thick-bottom pan.
6. Temper the egg mixture.
7. Back to the pan and cook until glossy and thick.
8. Add the vanilla.
9. Cover with a plastic wrap in contact. Bring to room temperature!
10. Add the softened butter to a bowl (still cold, but pliable) and whip.
11. Add the cottage cheese to the butter and whip again.
12. Add the praline to the cream base.
13. Add the pastry cream 1 tablespoon at a time, whipping on medium speed for 20 seconds in between each addition.
14. Once all the pastry cream is incorporated, turn the mixer on high again and whip for a further minute.

### --- Assembling ---
1. Trim the ends of the sponge.
2. Brush the coffee syrup on top.
3. Add the jam (a thin layer). Level out.
4. Add the pastry cream (a thin layer). Level out. (You must have 1/3 of the cream mixture still for the outer layer)
5. Using a pizza cutter, slice into 4 thin strips each cake and roll. Gather one after another, roll around the previous one. Until everything is used or is too thick to go on.
6. Precisely measure the diameter of the future cake and roll the marzipan (reserving some for the onion and mushrooms optionally).
7. Place the cake into the fridge. Meanwhile, eyeball and melt some chocolate (~50-60g) and add it to the the remaining cream (just enough to make it brown), then mix and pour it into a pastry bag, clean. Chill the cream (do not chill for too long, it will harden, if it's not too hot, don't chill it at all).
8.  Take the cake out, roll the marzipan into the diameter into about 0.3-0.4 cm thickness. Put it on top of the cake, level out. Make the cuts based on references. Begin to brush the initial layers. While they are drying.. go on.
9.  Apply a layer of cream to the sides, level out.
10. Get the chocolate out of the freezer, unroll and use it as bark in pieces. The reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izDZLDav-co
11. For all the chocolate that is left, melt it again (no need to temper) and brush on the sides. Add some kerob to brush at certain areas optionally).
12. (Optionally) make the red onion from the remaining marzipan.
13. Brush some corn syrup on certain areas and dust with some ground pistachios to make it look like moss (between the bark would be perfect).
14. Finish the top and the overall composition. Optionally apply the reserved hazelnuts as well.
