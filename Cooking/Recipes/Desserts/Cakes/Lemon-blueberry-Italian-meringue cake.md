| Diameter: 26cm<br><br>Italian meringue:<br>- meringue: 386g -> 625g (I want the topping more generous and everyone loved the top layer a lot)<br>- do not add fresh lemon juice, use dried. gelatin and vanilla is already a lot of liquid there, was hard to use it right away, kind of soft-peaked before gelatinized<br><br>Lemon mousse:<br>- gelatin 12g -> 9g, too dense, I will add gelatin to the curd for consistency and better aeration<br><br>Lemon curd:<br>- gelatin 0g -> 4g. It was too liquid before going to the mousse, even after chilling<br><br>Blueberry cremeux:<br>- gelatin 8g -> 4g (was very dense, the fruit puree itself was pretty much like jelly already after cooling)<br>- possibly omit the sugar<br><br>Sponge (blueberry sour cream):<br>- not nearly enough. Introduced one more almond sponge and use all of it. It was just right.<br>- butter 170g -> 100g <br>- sugar 300 -> 250g (too soggy because of the discard probably, and water from blueberries)<br>- egg whites 105g -> 135g<br>- milk 120g -> 90g<br><br> | Overall, the cake is brilliant and moist, reach, textured and contrast-like. But I find it a bit too fat, hence the alterations in some places. <br><br>In the perfect world, I would substitute Mascarpone for cottage cheese and make fruit puree layer plain, no yolks. |     |     |

## Plan:
Day 1:
- Sponge cake
- Blueberry puree.
- Lemon curd.
Day 2:
- Lemon mousse.
- Italian meringue.
- Assembling.
- Isomalt dew drops.
Day 3 (the serving day):
- finish decorating (torching and "berrying")

## Directions:

### Sponge cake (blueberry sour cream):
0. Get the butter out of the fridge.
1. Soak the discard in milk.
2. Beat together the wet ingredients, including the milk, sour cream, egg whites, lemon juice, zest and vanilla together in a medium bowl. Set aside
3. Into another medium bowl, sift the dry ingredients, including the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Remove two tablespoons and add it to a small bowl with the blueberries. Toss the berries to coat in flour and set aside.
4. In a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the softened butter on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed until the mixture is sandy. Stop and scrape down the bowl as needed.
5. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly pour in the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Scrape down the bowl and beat on medium-low speed until fluffy, about 30 seconds. Fold in flour-coated blueberry by hand with a spatula.
6. Divide the mixture evenly into the cake pans.
7. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the centers are springy to the touch. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 15 minutes, then remove them and place them on a wire cooling rack to cool completely.

### Blueberry puree:
1. Combine everything and bring to a boil, stirring while it thickens. Add more sugar if needed.

### Lemon curd

DO NOT USE ANYTHING METAL IN THIS. SILICON WHISK / WOODEN SPOON. NOTHING METAL / CAST IRON.
① Bloom the gelatin in ice-cold water. Rub the sugar and lemon zest together until even.
② Add the lemon juice, egg yolk, eggs, lemon sugar all into the saucepan and homogenize. Start heating up. Bring it up to a thick consistency. 
③ Add the gelatin in. 
④ Once the lemon curd cools down to 40~45℃ add in the room temp butter and blend.

### Blueberry cremeux:
- **Bloom gelatin:**  
    Add 10 g gelatin powder to 50 g cold water. Stir gently and let it bloom for 5–10 minutes.
- **Warm the purée:**  
    In a saucepan, gently heat the blueberry purée until warm but not boiling (around 50–60 °C).
- **Temper egg yolks:**  
    In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until pale and smooth.
- **Combine and cook:**  
    Slowly pour about half of the warm blueberry purée into the yolk mixture while whisking constantly (this tempers the yolks, preventing curdling).  
    Then, return the combined mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining blueberry purée.
- **Cook custard:**  
    Cook over low to medium heat, stirring constantly with a spatula or whisk, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Temperature should reach about 82–84 °C (180–183 °F). Do not boil or scramble the eggs!
- **Add gelatin:**  
    Remove from heat and immediately whisk in the bloomed gelatin until fully dissolved.
- **Strain (optional):**  
    Pass the mixture through a fine sieve into a clean bowl to ensure ultra-smooth texture.
- **Add butter:**  
    While the mixture is still warm (around 40–45 °C), whisk in the cold cubed butter piece by piece until fully emulsified and smooth.
- **Cool down:**  
    Cover the surface with plastic wrap (touching the surface to prevent skin) and refrigerate until chilled and thickened but still spreadable (4+ hours or overnight).
### Lemon mousse
1. **Bloom gelatin**: 10–12 g gelatin in 45–60 g cold water for 5–10 min.
2. **Warm gelatin**: gently heat (microwave in short bursts or over bain-marie) until gelatin liquefies — don’t boil. Let it cool to ~45–50 °C.
3. **Blend dairy base**: in a blender, combine **mascarpone + coconut cream + lemon curd + sugar + salt + vanilla**. Blend until silky and homogeneous. Taste and adjust sugar/acid. If the curd is very sharp, add a teaspoon of softened butter or an extra 10–20 g mascarpone (or 10 g sugar) to round it.
4. **Temper gelatin**: pour a little (2–3 tbsp) of the blended curd mix into the warm gelatin to temper, mix, then fold gelatin back into the main curd mix, whisking gently to combine. The mix should be warm-ish but not hot.
5. **Chill to thicken**: refrigerate the mix until it **starts to thicken but is still pourable/pipable** — about 20–45 minutes depending on your fridge. You want a consistency like thick custard (not fully set).
6. **Optional aeration**: to make it lighter, whip **150–200 g** chilled coconut cream to soft peaks and **fold** into the thickened base. This gives mousse loft and makes it pipeable without extra gelatin. If you want denser mousse, skip whipping and use as-is.
7. **Piping / layering**: fill a piping bag with the mousse. Pipe rings or even layers: since mousse is stabilized with gelatin, it will hold shape. If you want layered piped discs, pipe directly onto chilled cake layers or acetate rings. After piping each layer, chill the cake for 20–30 minutes to firm before adding next layer or applying meringue.
8. **Set fully**: after assembly, chill entire cake 4–6 hours (overnight preferred) to fully set gelatin.
### Isomalt dew drops
1. Be careful, melt a very small portion of isomalt.
2. Make small drops on a silicon mat / foil greased with oil.
3. Let it cool. Should be fine and shiny in an air-tight container for at least 3 weeks. No fridge, away from humidity.
### Assembling:
1. A sponge
2. A layer of blueberry cremeux in the center.
3. A layer of lemon mousse around.
4. Repeat.
5. Cover with Italian meringue with large waves. 
6. Torch it the day you're gonna serve. Decorate with blueberries and dew drops.
### Italian meringue:

① Bloom the gelatin in ice-cold water.
② Make 118℃ sugar syrup by boiling water and sugar1. 
③ Meanwhile, at the same time, whip the egg whites and sugar2 to make a French meringue. 
④ Pour the sugar syrup into the French meringue and continue to whip. 
⑤ Melt the lemon juice + gelatin mixture using a microwave and add this in. 
⑥ Whip until the Italian meringue cools down to room temp. 
⑦ Store it in the fridge if not used immediately.
