## Directions:
1. First, prepare the spring form. Use it closed, not open (28cm).
2. Use a **flat plate or cake board** with **acetate film** lining the inner ring.
3. Line the bottom of the ring with plastic wrap tightly as well!
4. Line the 26cm spring form with a film on the bottom to prepare for the cooled caramel freezing.

### --- Simple chocolate sponge (26cm) ---
1. Add eggs, sugar and salt. Whisk until pale and light. Use hand mixer.
2. In a separate bowl, combine flour, cocoa powder and baking powder
3. Add 1/2 of the dry mixture into the eggs', carefully.
4. Add milk and oil together with the remaining dry ingredients.
5. Mix carefully until no lumps and uniform.
6. Bake 180C for ~20C until a skewer comes out clean.

### --- Salted-peanut caramel layer (26cm) ---
1. Soak the gelatin in cold water.
2. Add sugar, water and syrup to a pot and cook until it's a dark amber color caramel (175-180C).
3. Take it off the heat. Add the butter all at once and stir.
4. Add the heavy cream, stir.
5. Back on heat. Bring back to a slow simmer for 1-2 minutes (until 118-120C = soft chewy stage). 
6. Add salt.
7. Stir until 60C, add the gelatin and vanilla.
8.  When it reaches at least 45C, pour and spread into 26cm round mold (covered with parchment), freeze.

### --- Honey French-style nougat (26cm) ---
- **Start both syrups at the same time:**
    - In **saucepan 1**, cook the **honey** to **121°C**.
    - In **saucepan 2**, cook the **sugar + water + corn syrup** to **140°C**.
    - **Tip**: Stir sugar syrup _only until dissolved_, then stop stirring to avoid crystallization.
    
- **While syrups are heating**, start whipping:
    - Begin whipping egg whites, salt, and 5 g sugar on low-medium speed until **soft to firm peaks** form.
        
- **When the honey hits ~121°C:**
    - **Slowly drizzle** the honey into the whipped egg whites **while the mixer is running** at medium speed.
    - This will gently cook and stabilize the meringue.
    
- **As the sugar syrup hits ~140°C:**
    - **Immediately drizzle it** into the meringue-honey mix **in a thin stream**, again while whipping.
    
- Continue whipping the nougat mixture on medium-high speed until:
    - The **bowl cools down to ~60°C (this takes 5–7 minutes). NOT lower, it will harden.
    - The texture should become **thick, sticky, glossy, and stretchy**.
        
- **Add the peanut butter** at this stage:
    - Stir it in **by hand or on low speed** until fully incorporated.
    - This gives flavor and slight chewiness without deflating the nougat.

- Pour over the frozen caramel layer and distribute with an offset spatula.


### Cottage cheese chocolate mousse layer
1. Soak the gelatin in cold water.
2. Make sure the mold is already prepared and the sponge, caramel and nougat are already assembled, waiting for the mousse.
3. Heat milk and sugar until the sugar is dissolved.
4. When the mixture is at 60C, add the bloomed gelatin.
5. Blend cottage cheese while gradually adding heated sweet milk to help it blend. Set aside.
6. Whip the cream to soft peaks. 
7. Take the respective part of the cottage cheese mixture for the white layer and mix in the part of the whipped cream carefully with a spatula. Refrigerate the remaining cream.
8. Melt the chocolate to 40-45C (don't exceed 50C).
9. Pour the chocolate into a high blender jar and add a bit of the cottage cheese mixture to temper. Blend.
	- **TIP: Don’t pour cold mousse into warm chocolate! That creates grainy texture.**
10. Keep adding the mousse gradually. 
11. Now, add the chocolate mixture into the mousse carefully.
12. Take the cream from the fridge, incorporate it into the mousse with a spatula, gently.
13. Keep the white layer nearby in a warm environment to prevent stabilization. Freeze the chocolate mousse in the mold for 20 minutes, then pour the white one over it. Refrigerate.

- Chocolate sponge
