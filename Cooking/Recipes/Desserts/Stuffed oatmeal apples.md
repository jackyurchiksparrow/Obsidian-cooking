## Directions:

1. Core each apple, making a large well in the center; place onto a rimmed baking sheet.
2. Mix oats, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl; cut in butter / oil until well combined. Spoon 1/4 of the oat mixture into each apple.
3. Bake in the preheated oven at 180C until apples are tender and filling is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
