## Directions:

1. Bake the carrots and garlic by placing them in foil. Cut the carrots in quarters.
2. Wash the quinoa thoroughly with you hands involved. Only measure water by not more that 1.5 of the quinoa weight. 
3. Add water to a HEAVY-BOTTOM pot, along with quinoa and  bring to a boil. Cook on very low until it's light and fluffy, cooked through (not until all the water absorbed), drain immediately.
4. Make the mayo while it's cooling.
5. Chop the vegetables and greens, mix everything together, season.
6. Add the quinoa. Add the dressing.
