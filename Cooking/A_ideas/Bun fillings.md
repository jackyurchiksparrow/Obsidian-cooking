	- I take half a stick of just softened butter and start slowly mashing pieces of a ripe banana in with a fork. I add banana until it is barely starting to break. Then I add sugar to make a paste (about 1/2 cup) and an egg yolk. Along with cinnamon and a pinch of salt. If it seems too runny I sprinkle in some flour, but the egg yolk helps it set up when baked.
- Dates
- Sweet potato
- Orange / walnut
	- I make a normal cinnamon sugar butter paste with tons of orange rind and finely ground walnuts, so small it's like a very coarse meal.
