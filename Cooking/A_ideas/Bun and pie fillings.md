- Banana
	- I take half a stick of just softened butter and start slowly mashing pieces of a ripe banana in with a fork. I add banana until it is barely starting to break. Then I add sugar to make a paste (about 1/2 cup) and an egg yolk. Along with cinnamon and a pinch of salt. If it seems too runny I sprinkle in some flour, but the egg yolk helps it set up when baked.
- Dates
- Sweet potato
- Orange / walnut
	- I make a normal cinnamon sugar butter paste with tons of orange rind and finely ground walnuts, so small it's like a very coarse meal.

Pre-cooking the fruit:
1. Prepare, peel and slice apples and pears. Squeeze half a lemon on them.
2. Cook the apples and pears with cinnamon and ginger until they are soft and most of the water has cooked out.

Toffee sauce:
1. Add sugar, water and (optionally) corn syrup to a pot and cook until it's a dark amber color caramel (175-180C).
2. Take it off the heat. Add the cream **gradually in multiple additions and stir**.
3. Add the butter. Back on heat.
4. Bring the mixture to 118-120C = soft chewy stage).
5. Off the heat, add salt and vanilla.

Usage:
1. If you want to add it to a pie, put the apples onto the bottom crust.
2. Cover with the toffee sauce.
3. Bake, it will melt onto the filling.

4. If you want to add it to buns, then spread the toffee sauce first, then put some apples inside.
5. Bake.
