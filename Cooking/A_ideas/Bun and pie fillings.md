- Classic chocolate
- Ground nuts + sugar + spices
- Raspberry + almonds
- Poppy seed
- Poppy seed + chocolate
- Banana
	- I take half a stick of just softened butter and start slowly mashing pieces of a ripe banana in with a fork. I add banana until it is barely starting to break. Then I add sugar to make a paste (about 1/2 cup) and an egg yolk. Along with cinnamon and a pinch of salt. If it seems too runny I sprinkle in some flour, but the egg yolk helps it set up when baked.
- Dates
- Sweet potato
- Orange / walnut
	- I make a normal cinnamon sugar butter paste with tons of orange rind and finely ground walnuts, so small it's like a very coarse meal.

![|500](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczM8BfTphxfjRg8WNBJzkMn6dOG0ix9_SULx-OcSkMkJ4BG10dMbxpP85WPWpxyUPsB58CdWhaCDlqtcEvXr4SoA10wRYvdKwxqW69C-4ya4gLD0y-xXnrW_MT5obLcGYEmxtsidTrJUVPJ20wYVahYk=w960-h1280-s-no-gm?authuser=0)

Poppy seeds — 250 g  
Milk 1 — 150 g  
Milk 2 — 25g (ONLY if it looks really dry, then cook it out thoroughly)
Sugar — 130 g  
Butter — 25 g  
Raisins dark - 25g  
Fine breadcrumbs — 25 g (only if it looks liquid, if just too wet while hot, then do nothing and leave to cool)
Egg - 50g (when it has cooled down - if baking)

> Do not use old poppy seeds, they are bitter and you have to rinse them thoroughly and undergo their wetness in the rest of the procedure, which is too tough, better throw them away.

1. While they are still dry, grind them in a coffee grinder.
2. Heat the milk 1 until almost boils, soak the poppy seed covered for 60min / overnight.
3. Add sugar and raisins, optionally milk 2, cook on very low constantly stirring while the milk is boiling away.
4. Off of the heat, add butter and stir on the hot stove. 
5. Consider if adding breadcrumbs is necessary, you can always add them later, with the egg.
6. Add the egg before using (if using in baking)
